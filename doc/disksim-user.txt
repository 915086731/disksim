Subject: [Disksim-users] Seek time calculation
Message-ID: <e8e8ae4e0507151324622c5b55@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, 
For my disk, I am using hpl seek time function. I set up the requests
so that only the second part of the equation is valid. However, Avg
seek distance value is not matching the avg. seek time value reported
in the output file. (I am supposed to get a different avg seek time
value if I plug the avg seek distance value into the hpl seek time
equation)

I would appreciate any comments..

Thank you.

1.  The hpl equation is *old*.  All modern disks have a seek curve too
tricky to be accurately modeled by it; we use a piecewise/extracted
curve ("full seek curve") instead.

2.  It may be hard to make a sensible comparision between the average
seek time of the disk "on paper" and under a real workload.  If your
workload is uniformly random across the entire LBN space, I'd think it
might match up but under any other circumstances, the distribution of
the trace and effects of the cache will change it.

Hi, I am using the Cheetah 9LP disksim model and seeing average
I/O times as high as 100ms for a heavy workload.  Might I be
doing something wrong or is this reasonable in some cases? Under
other workloads, it's down as low as 8ms average.

Thanks

Which stat are you looking at in the output?  If your workload causes
queueing at the disk or elsewhere in the system, you may be seeing the
result of such delays in your stats.

Subject: [Disksim-users] Disk Transfer Time
Message-ID: <e8e8ae4e050721072829df0a2a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have a question about the transfer time component of the access time in disk. 

For a single zoned disk, I believe for a single block request, this
value is the full revolution time of the disk divided by number of
blocks in a track.

When I have requests with two blocks, and no caching, transfer time is
higher than the twice of the number I obtain for the single block
request.

What exactly is included in that excess time? A possible head switch
when the second block is on a different surface than the first one,
and a possible cylinder switch when it is on a different cylinder?

Thank you.

Message-ID: <e8e8ae4e05072914195a0d3212@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have a question about the disk cache hits.

Does a read request wait in driver queue until all the previous
requests are serviced, or is it satisfied right away if the cache
contains its data?

I have a highly sequential arrival stream, and when read requests are
waiting very little, writes are waiting forty times the read requests.

allow almost read hits, and all sneaky read hit variables are set to 0.

I would really appreciate any comments.

Thank you.

Hi again,

I noticed that, if a request is created sequential to the previous
one, it is always a read if the previous request is a read, and write
if previous one was write.

Is there any way to change that? Or am I missing something?

Thank you very much for your help.

Hello,

I am using Disksim for a project to retrieve the seek and rotation time,
where I provide block numbers using the trace files. I have a few
questions.

1. Which trace file do I use? Ascii or validate?
2. What are the different parameters in the validate format? The manual
mentions only the ascii (default) format.
3. Can I print individual seek and rotation time for each IO in the output
file? If yes, then where do I modify the code? If not, is there any way I
could get it from the code?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks

Has this been always the case?  Latest version of DISKsim 3.0 from the
website, and after I get it to compile, both on CYGWIN on windows and
Redhat with 2.4.9 kernel I get some significant differences.  Are these
differences known?  Is there a fix, either in runvalid or in the code?

hi shemtov,

Request submission and completion at the IOdriver level is done in 
handle_new_request and iodriver_access_complete functions respectively in 
iodriver_disksim.c. From here you can track the complete flow.

Hope this helps,

Hi 

In syssim_driver.c, the next request is assumed to be dispatched until the
last one has finished and reported by disksim. So here we don't need to know
the request id when the syssim_report_completion() is triggered. 

In disksim 3.0, there is a syssim_driver2.c which shows a more useful
example about using disksim as slave.  The code is much longer than
syssim_driver.c.  But you can tailor it to your needs.

I've run disksim 3.0 with both gcc 2.95 and 3.43. No problem with
different gcc versions except some tiny compiling errors due to string
formating when using newer version of gcc. But it is not difficult to fix.

Hi there,

The wrong configuration may lead to segment fault. In your case, it is
also possible related to the difference between IA32 and IA64. But I
don't have environment and experience to run disksim under IA64. I'm
just curious about the scale of your simulation and how IA64 can help to
improve the simulation speed?

you can get some trace files from here. And the trace has been used in some outstanding papers.

Message-ID: <200608142203050077003@126.com>

Hello,disksim-users

I  have  scratched  my  head  to  compile  the  great  disksim  3.0  on  an  IA64  machine,but  when  I  run  disksim  on  IA64,  it  give  me  a  segment  fault. And I have got to know that the segment fault happened on the 1065 line in the "libparam/util.c" file (i.e. the libparamparse() function call). Because I am confused with the bison toolkit,I can't modify the libparam.y filt to make the libparamparse() usable.
Has anyone succeeded in compiling disksim on IA64? Any suggestion or comment is welcome.


Best  Luck!

the short answer is no, you shouldn't change the ioreq_event struct if 
you can help it.  the ioreq_event struct does have a member called buf 
which you can use you maintain a pointer to the "system level" request 
(which contains the ID field).  If you look at the 
disksim_request_arrive function you'll see the system level request 
parameter is a pointer and that pointer is assigned to the buf member of 
the ioreq_event.  you should do the samething in your implmentation.

the reason for not adding the ID field to ioreq_event is that the core 
disksim structs have been sized to optimize memory allocation during 
simulation so increasing the size of this struct could unnecessarily 
slow down your simulation.

Not to mention the fact that (IIRC) there is some code that casts some
of those structs around in weird ways that may mysteriously break if
you change it.

Hello,John  Bucy,
    I wonder when the new release of disksim will come out. At least, I want to know where to get the disk specification file of some newer disk typies whose capacity is more than 10GB. After all, the disk typies described by the disk specification file along wiht disksim 3.0 is too old.


All  the  best.

the data type.

  if (sscanf(line, "%c %s %d %d %lf %lf\n", &rw, validate_buffaction, 
&new->blkno, &new->bcount, &servtime, &validate_nextinter) != 6)

Message-ID: <20060829221317.13625.qmail@web42404.mail.scd.yahoo.com>

Dear Disksim users,

I intend to use several copies of disksim simultaneously, 
using disksim_interface.c. I think I can init several disksim copies, 
even using the same parameter file (?). 
Then I can activate each disksim copy separately, 

while they are all synchronized with the system time. 
The functions syssim_schedule_callback, syssim_deschedule_callback, 
syssim_report_completion will be invoked only by the disksim copy 
currently performs an internal event. 

Am I correct? Is the something I should note? 

I would also like to join a question previously ask in the forum - 
Does anybody have disk specification files newer then those published? 
This could really be a great help, since I feel my research may be much 
stronger using up-to-date disk specification.

Very best, and 10x for any help,
Haya Shemtov

I would be shocked if this actually worked correctly;  there is a huge
amount of global state inside disksim; multiple instances will corrupt
each other.  If you really need to do this, you can probably fork off
processes and do the synchronization with some kind of ipc.

I've been working on this in my (limited) spare time and I wish it was
done 9 months ago but there are only so many hours in the day :(

Can you open an account for public CVS access to the latest source so

Subject: [Disksim-users] Ask help on cmd line parameter overrides in disksim
	3.0 ?
Message-ID: <001301c637ea$1d68f310$6400a8c0@Safari>

Hi, all

Any one has experience with disksim 3.0 command line parameter overrides? I
try to override the disksim synthetic generator parameters through command
line override interface to do a sensitivity study on RAID performance.  

To be specifically, I want to vary the mean value of "General inter-arrival
times" from 10ms to 100ms.  

 I know the manual has a simple example to illustrate how to adjust the disk
schedule algorithm. But the general inter-arrival time is defined as a tuple
in the parameter file. ( General inter-arrival times  = [ exponential, 0.0,
50.0  ],) I tried the following command but it does not work. 

$ ../src/disksim raid1.parv out ascii 0 1 "gen0" "General inter-arrival
times" 10; 

The following is the generator configuration. 

 disksim_synthio Synthio {
   Number of I/O requests to generate =  50000,
   Maximum time of trace generated  =  9999999.0,
   System call/return with each request =  0,
   Think time from call to request =  0.0,
   Think time from request to return =  0.0,
   Generators = [
     disksim_synthgen gen0 { # generator 0 
       Storage capacity per device  =  16448064,
       devices = [ disk3 ], 
       Blocking factor =  8,
       Probability of sequential access =  0.4,
       Probability of local access =  0,
       Probability of read access =  1,
       Probability of time-critical request =  0,
       Probability of time-limited request =  0,
       Time-limited think times  = [ normal, 30.0, 100.0  ],
       General inter-arrival times  = [ exponential, 0.0, 50.0  ],
       Sequential inter-arrival times  = [ exponential, 0.0, 10.0  ],
       Local inter-arrival times  = [ exponential, 0.0, 10.0  ],
       Local distances  = [ normal, 0.0, 40000.0  ],
       Sizes  = [ exponential, 0.0, 64.0  ]
     } # end of generator 0
   ] # end of generator list 
} # end of synthetic workload spec

I think there should be some methods to override this type of parameters.
Any help will be appreciated!

Hi, John

Maybe we can do  a slight modification of the syntax by assigning each
parameter in the list an explicit name. Therefore, if we want to change the
mean of General inter-arrival times, we can use "General inter-arrival
times: mean" to override it.

For example, we change the syntax of

 General inter-arrival times  = [ exponential, 0.0, 50.0  ],

to

General inter-arrival times = 
{
	type = "exponential",
	base = 0.0,
	mean = 50.0
}

This is a known shortcoming of the syntax of the overrides;  you can't
"reach into" a list using that mechanism currently.  I know this is a pain
point for many users so we'll see about getting it fixed before we release a
new version in the coming weeks/months.

In the meantime, I'm afraid you'll have to write some perl or something to
edit the parameter file and run disksim.

Message-ID: <20060106024644.32478.qmail@web34601.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello disksim users/developers!

I have disksim 3.0 up and running and am adding a new
type of cache to the front end of it to test my PhD
thesis.  I was wondering if there are any newer disk
models and diskspecs available than the Quantum Atlas
10K from 1999?  

I realize that there is a description for
automatically profiling disks from userland in Linux
called DIXTRAC on the PDL website.  I'd be happy to
profile my own disk setups if I had access to that
software, but I'd be perfectly satisfied with some
specs for a recent drive.  Any chance of that? 
Response by private email is fine.

We're working on a new release which has a new layout model that
supports newer disks.  We have quite good models of e.g. the Seagate
Cheetah15k4.

Hi,
Is there a brief description of the 27 scheduling algorithms used by
DiskSim? I don't understand what the extensions CYL, and OPT refer to.
What is
CYCLE_LBN,
WPTF_OPT (Weighted with respect to what?)
SDF
TSPS
SPTF_ROT_OPT
 SPTF_ROT_WEIGHT
 SPTF_SEEK_WEIGHT

Lastly, are C-SCAN, LOOK and C-LOOK simulated?

Thank you.

The manual has references to the various literature where these
algorithms are described.  And you can always look at the source code.
 Beyond that, I don't really know.  I imagine many of those were
"one-offs" that someone needed at some time or another for one
experiment that accumulated in the codebase.  I'd stick to the
algorithms used in validated diskspecs or make sure you really
understand what the algorithm is doing before you mess with some of
the more esoteric ones.

Can someone explain the use of opid in the ioreq_event structure?  
Almost all of the source code sets it to zero and the documentation says 
to set it to zero when dealing with iotraces.  My intention would be to 
use it as a unique identifier for requests. I want to make sure 
assigning this variable arbitrary values won't kill the simulator.

Hi, Shahrukh

It is used for identify a logical request during the request mapping at RAID
(or logorg) level.
Check disksim_logorg.c and you will find that for each logorg, the opid is
maintained like a sequence no. 

 int logorg_maprequest (logorg **logorgs, int numlogorgs, ioreq_event *curr)
{
......
curr->opid = logorgs[logorgno]->opid;
......
 logorgs[logorgno]->opid++;

}

Subject: [Disksim-users] ioreq_event's opid field

Can someone explain the use of opid in the ioreq_event structure?  
Almost all of the source code sets it to zero and the documentation says to
set it to zero when dealing with iotraces.  My intention would be to use it
as a unique identifier for requests. I want to make sure assigning this
variable arbitrary values won't kill the simulator.

Do you want to collect trace yourself from your system?
If that is the case, there are many linux kernel patches can do this 
such as LL_TRACE for 2.4 kernel.

Hi, Aniket,

I haven't use the validation trace before. It seems that the manual does 
not include detailed information about its format.
But you can check the source code and find the format of the validation 
trace. Based on  my understanding, the one validate trace record is 
composed of the following segments:

* Read/Write Flag
* Buffer Action (Hit/Miss)
* Request Address (blkno)
* Request Size (bcount)
* Service time (Real)
* Next Interarrival time (Real)

Check the following code (from disksim 2.0) for details. Disksim 3.0 
does not change the format of validation trace. Hope this will be helpful.

ioreq_event * iotrace_validate_get_ioreq_event (FILE *tracefile, 
ioreq_event *new)
{
   char line[201];
   char rw;
   double servtime;

   if (fgets(line, 200, tracefile) == NULL) {
      addtoextraq((event *) new);
      return(NULL);
   }
   new->time = simtime + (validate_nextinter / (double) 1000);
   if (sscanf(line, "%c %s %d %d %lf %lf\n", &rw, validate_buffaction, 
&new->blkno, &new->bcount, &servtime, &validate_nextinter) != 6) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Wrong number of arguments for I/O trace event 
type\n");
      exit(0);
   }
   validate_lastserv = servtime / (double) 1000;
   if (rw == 'R') {
      new->flags = READ;
   } else if (rw == 'W') {
      new->flags = WRITE;
   } else {
      fprintf(stderr, "Invalid R/W value: %c\n", rw);
      exit(0);
   }
   new->devno = 0;
   new->buf = 0;
   new->opid = 0;
   new->cause = 0;
   new->busno = 0;
   new->tempint2 = 0;
   new->tempint1 = 0;
   validate_lastblkno = new->blkno;
   validate_lastbcount = new->bcount;
   validate_lastread = new->flags & READ;
   return(new);
}

Subject: [Disksim-users] subdivide latency
Message-ID: <44B6A1FF.9050500@cs.virginia.edu>

Is it possible to subdivide the latency of a request? For example, if a 
request takes 3ms. then is there a mechanism for knowing that 1.5ms 
where spent on the disk mechanics, 0.5ms. were in some adapter or bus, 
and 1.0ms. some other overhead.  I really just want to be able to 
subdivide the latency between disk mechanics and the datas transmission 
through the logical/physical organization. Thanks.

I don't think that this functionality exists presently though the
usual quick/hacky solution would be to put some prints in.  Also,
remember that a lot of these activities are overlapped with each other
which makes this a little harder to think about.

At a lower level, the diskmodel API does expose this (look for 'struct
dm_mech_acctimes' in diskmodel/dm.h) but that won't give you
cache/controller/bus/etc, just mechanics.

Yeah, I was worried i'd lose the controller/cache numbers.  Is it 
possible to turn off all the latencies of the organization on the fly? 
So that I can simulate disks using the current setup of disksim, but 
only see latencies from communication when I want to.  Thanks.

You could add a global variable somewhere that you condition all your
prints on and then you could turn them on and off on the fly...

Thanks for the patch!  In fact, this has been fixed in our CVS tree
for some time.  The upcoming release will include fixes to these
problems but your patch should be useful to other users who've gotten bit by
this issue in the meantime.

Hi,
I have big problem regarding with trace extraction.
I had tried to install ll_trace.
But I can't install.
Tell me any other way to install.
Other thing is that,  which are the parameters in the simulator?
I have figure out some parameters such as
1.block size
2.data layout
3.contiguous memory
How can I vary these parameters?
please tell me as early as possible.
I am waiting the reply.

The upcoming release of disksim will include validated models of much
newer disks, e.g. Seagate Cheetah15k4, etc.

If we put up a wiki or something, we could perhaps have a "user
contributed" section for stuff like this.

Is it safe to assume that an array of identical disks will each have the 
exact same number of disk blocks, as reported by getdisk(i)->numblocks?  
I want to make sure there isn't some arbitrary way for one disk to have 
even one or two more blocks than another (although this happens in real 
disks).  Thanks.

Subject: [Disksim-users] accessing logorg struct
Message-ID: <448F2326.4030805@cs.virginia.edu>

Sorry to ask such an implementation type question but I've been plagued 
by this for almost 2 days.  I am writing a program which controls the 
disksim simulator (i.e. treats it as a slave).  Thus I need certain 
information regarding the state of the simulation.  Specifically I need 
to if the storage system is addressed by Array or by Parts.  It seems 
there is no way to access the logical organization structure (struct 
logorg which contains a member called addrbyparts) from outside the 
disksim code base.  I've delved deeply into the disksim code and I'm not 
even sure how its done in the base code.

I've narrowed my problem to the fact that the disksim_t struct uses 
forward declarations to make the compiler happy when defining pointers 
to other structs like iodriver_info.  The errors I get imply that the 
unit I am compiling cannot see all of the structure definitions it 
needs.  I think the forward declarations allow this to occur.

Hopefully this makes some sense; in my own code I try to access the 
addrbyparts variable like this:
    disksim->iodriver_info->sysorgs->addrbyparts
where disksim, iodriver_info, and sysorgs are structure pointers and 
which are members in the subsequent structure.  Disksim has macros 
defined similiar to this in disksim_iodriver.c, so its odd that it 
wouldn't work.

 I tried a little test:
    int x = disksim->intqlen;  // this compiles fine which means the 
disksim struct definition can be seen

Then I tried:
    int x = disksim->iodriver_info->numiodrivers  // this gives me the 
same error I initially incountered regarding the compliation unit not 
seeing the definition of struct iodriver_info.

Any help resolving this issue would be appreciated.  I hope changing the 
core disksim code is not necessary as I would like my own code to be 
able to work as an extension to disksim rather than as patch work to 
arbitrary code segments.  Thanks.

I have never worked extensively in that code so my short answer is, "I
don't know."

We made a point of separating out the interface stuff such that it
doesn't include any other internal disksim headers which are really
messy and will often caused name/symbol clashes with other code.  You
probably need to #include some of these headers in order to reach that
far down into the data structures.

Another option might be to get it "out of band" somehow, e.g. read it
out of the parameter file yourself.

Hi all,

I am a new user of disksim. I have some doubts listed below.

a) Instead of submitting all the disk requests in a trace file, i want to 
send the subsequent requests only when i know that the previous request is 
done with the disk, that is number of outstanding request should be one. 
In short, i want to know if the previous request has finished using the 
disk.

b) How to increase the size of the disk? (say barracuda disk from 2 gb to 
40gb), i understand that it is not straight forward (just increasing the 
number of sectors)

thank you,

There is not a way to do this out of the box.  What I would do is use
the external interface to run disksim as a library and use some
lightweight threads package (gnu pth, state threads, etc) and run the
disksim event loop in one and each of your trace replays in separate
threads.  Your runtime would synchronize all of this so that the
simulated IOs in each of the trace replays would look like a blocking
call in simulated time.  Does that make sense?

To get anything like realistic results, it is non-trivial to do this
because all of those parameters interact in pretty subtle ways.  Also,
that barracuda model is from ~1994 IIRC -- really really old.  I know
this probably doesn't help you right now but we are going to have a
new release that will include valdiated models of much newer, larger
disks.

There is some old checkpointing code in there but I don't think its
been used for years and I don't know whether it even works anymore.  I
never used it my self and I'm not sure if its fine-grained enough for
what you're describing here.

Otherwise, I'm not aware of anyone in our group actively looking into
doing this for disksim.  Off the top of my head, I imagine it would be
rather difficult and invasive.

If you use disksim 3.0, the valid directory has many good samples for RAID
0, 1, 5.  RAID 10 can be configured based on these samples with slight

Disksim 2.0 is really old;  you almost certainly want 3.0.

If I recall correctly, there are currently a few minor code problems
that prevent the 3.0 release from compiling with newer versions of
GCC.  Ubuntu probably has a package of gcc 2.95 which should
definitely work.  Try

apt-get install gcc-2.95

and then in the disksim directory

make CC=gcc-2.95

I imagine is the same story for disksim 2 but I don't really remember.

Message-ID: <200611162339241563639@tom.com>

Hi,

    I am working on augmenting the support of the switch of the disk status, such as active, idle, standby, sleep in the disksim. And I have a problem.
    If the current status of a disk is sleep while an I/O request arrives, the disk can not serve the request immediately and must wait for a period, call wake-up time, to serve it. So, the events in terms of the disk should be delayed till the disk is ready waked-up. considering the RAID configuration, only the corresponding events of the waking-up disks should be delayed and the other events for the other disks which are in the active/idle status should be handled without delay.
    the question is: how can I do something in the disksim, to differentiate the events' cause by the different disks. If I block all of the events in the event loop once a disk is in the sleep status, it leads to an unfair and wrong result.
    any suggestion is appreciated.

So your setup is that you have a bunch of disks and at any given time,
some of them are active and some of them are sleeping or whatever and
you want the requests that map to disks that are on to issue
immediately and the ones that map to disks that are asleep to be
delayed for the disk to wake up?

I would expect that you'd have to implement that in the logorg code in
disksim.  Maybe you could introduce a special "wakeup" request that
you'd enqueue ahead of any request that accesses a disk that's asleep
and arrange for it to block everything else in the queue, etc.

Dear All,
For your info. After trying and facing the errors during install disksim3.0 in ubuntu 6.06 ,May be I can share the steps :

# sudo apt-get install build-essential    { this is for installing make command) 

Then remove the packace : gcc, gcc-4.0, cpp, cpp-4.0. You can use Synaptic (System ? Administration ? Synaptic Package Manager ) to uninstall


Then install : cpp-2.95, gcc-2.95, bison, flex-old (do not use flex) and indent. (You can download indent from http://kambing.vlsm.org/ubuntu/pool/main/i/indent/ , and searching for others in this link too)

then run
#make CC=gcc-2.95 in disksim folder

then run # ./runvalid in ../valid folder

This is my step. Hopefully help someone who face same problem.

thks
Agus gogon

Subject: [Disksim-users] should the NULL_EVENT and BUS_DELAY_COMPLETION
	events be delayed during the wake-up period of a disk?
Message-ID: <200611282307167654925@tom.com>

Hi,

    I encount  a problem on augmenting the support of the switch of the disk status, such as active, idle, standby, sleep in the disksim.
    I can delay some events during the wake-up period of a disk till the disk is really waken up.  But if I delay the NULL_EVENT event and the BUS_DELAY_COMPLETION event, the disksim will output some errors as follows and stops.

NULL_EVENT event:
Trace event appears out of time order in trace - simtime 34219.413995, time 32309.570000
ioscale 1.000000, tracebasetime 0.000000
devno 0, blkno 61481, bcount 3, flags 0

BUS_DELAY_COMPLETION event:
diskno(14):Cannot find ioreq in disk_buffer_update_outbuffer

I think BUS_DELAY_COMPLETION's error can be ignored because this event should not be delayed. But how about the NULL event? If I do not delay this event, the disksim can work well.
Should it be delayed or not?

any hints are appreciated, and thank John Bucy for his answer to my last question.

:)

It sounds like that's a bug, perhaps in the layout code.  In general,
that model is *very* old.  I think about the newest one in the 3.0
release distribution is the atlas10k model which you might want to try
instead.  And in response to your question, you definitely should be
able to access every lbn from 0 to n-1.

A simple partitioning scheme will split the underlying block device
(disk, raid, etc) into contiguous ranges of LBNs.  Disksim is just a
block device so it doesn't know/care -- your requests to the first
partition would be constrained to the first lbn range, etc.

Because of the way the workload generator is integrated into the main
disksim event loop, I expect it wouldn't be completely trivial to pull
it out -- you'd probably have to reimplement some of the environment
it expects to run in.  But you can probably lift out code that
computes the sizes/lbns/interarrival times/etc and wrap your own
"driver harness" around it.

Disksim users,
I would like to migrate my disksim from old red-hat 7.3 to a newer platform like ubuntu.
  I installed on my ubuntu box gcc-2.95 and other tools like flex, bison etc. Yet, I got the following error, trying to ?make? disksim:
   
  lex.libparam.o lex.libparam.c 
libparam.lex: In function `libparamlex': 
libparam.lex:141: `yy_current_buffer' undeclared (first use in this function)

libparam.lex:141: for each function it appears in.) 
libparam.lex: At top level: 
lex.libparam.c:1315: warning: `yyunput' defined but not used 
make[1]: *** [lex.libparam.o] Error 1
   
  is that a version problem or some tool is missing?
Is error in libparam.lex related to flex package? 
What should I do?
Very best,
shay

Try 'apt-get install flex-old' -- I believe there may be a problem
with newer versions of flex.

Subject: [Disksim-users] separate write cache
Message-ID: <ce68cf5a0610121249n5be9815esbd50fd6acc9ac79b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm using Disksim 2.0. I am just not sure how to implement a separate write
cache buffer from a read cache. I want my write cache buffer to (1) have
multi-segments, (2) piggybacks the write requests when the read/write head
passes the disk sectors, and (3) sends the write requests to the disk when
the disk is idle. How can I set the parameter files to implement that? Right
now I set these parameters:

Number of buffer segments: 1024
Maximum number of write segments: 512
Use separate write segment: 1
Immediate buffer write: 1

The write cache papers claimed that the cache can improve the performance
significantly. However, the output from my settings seems not to change
much. Do I need to set anything else?

Thank you.

Our recent experience has been that the disk cache code in disksim is
pretty opaque and fragile;  we've had instances where, e.g. changing
the parameters to try to disable the writeback cache has uncovered
bugs or otherwise didn't work.  Sorry I can't be more helpful than
that.

I download and install the DiskSim 3 in my Redhat 9 box, and it can be compiled and run "valid/runvalid" well.
But if I only change the IOdriver's Scheduling Policy from "1"(FCFS) to "8"(SPTF), it is aborted. why?

I'm interested in pulling the disk model out of disksim, and I ran 
across the function disk_get_servtime() in disksim_diskctlr.c.  Will 
this function calculate the service time of the request without changing 
the state of the disk model, or is it like making a normal disksim 
request without going through the logical/physical organization of 
drivers, controllers, and buses?  Thanks.

What do you mean by "pulling the disk model out"?  If you want the
whole controller/cache/scheduler, this is not really possible;  the
model is not anything like "closed form" and is defined in terms of
the whole state machine.   If you just want layout and mechanics, you
can get that from the diskmodel library.  You can always configure a
setup with a 0-time controller/bus/etc if you don't want those
effects.  What exactly are you trying to do?

Hello,Shahrukh,
    First,what I wonder is that even if the negative value makes disksim work well, does it make sense to you?
    Second, I advise you to make smooth the trace file (out of time order)by writing a toolkit. It is not hard.
    Third, I don't know the way you use disksim. Do you use disksim as a slave module or play the trace with disksim itself? If the latter, I have no idea. If the former, I have a thread that the syssim.c has a little bug with respect to calculatiing time.

    I hope it is useful to you.


All the best.

Sorry for my late reply Steve, I've had a procmail bug which has been 
redirecting all my disksim mail to the wrong directory. To answer your 
questions:

I've tested disksim using a negative time scale value and it never seems 
to break. As far as it making sense... I don't think it does. My 
original problem was the traffic in my traces were time stamped so close 
together (on the order of 1000th of a millisecond) that disksim could 
not handle it. Making the time stamp negative has been the only way to 
get disksim to run to completion on these particular fine-grain traces.

I am using disksim in two ways: 1) as a slave to a system level 
simulator 2) as a validator to the storage simulation in 1. This problem 
I'm having only occur when validating via traces.

In the past week I've gone very in depth to manually calculate the 
request latencies disksim provides when the time stamp is negative. 
There seems to be no problem in running disksim this way, but I agree it 
doesn't make sense to do so. I'll just say it works and it is something 
to try if you ever have to run fine-grain time stamped traces in disksim.

Hello,Shahrukh Rohinton Tarapore,
    I ran the disksim simulator under the trace whose time granularity is the same to yours,i.e. micro-second. It should be noted by you that the unit of the internal time in disksim is different from that of the sys time in the system level simulator. The unit in the latter is a second. So you can divide your timestamp by 10e6.
    I hope it will work.

All the best.

Subject: [Disksim-users] DiskSim for linux (hopefully without compilation
	issues)
Message-ID: <4c2098aa0704032351v5dbd0503hf3649c71fbecb530@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
There have been some emails regarding complitation problems with
DiskSim-3.0on linux.
I have put up a version of disksim on my webpage, that should compile on
linux without much work. Once you have unzipped and untarred the file, there
will be a file in main directory called - HOW-TO-COMPILE.Ajay, that talks
about detailed instructions for compiling. The files in various directories
have been suitably modified to make it work.

I have tested it on Ubuntu, with gcc-4.0.3,  flex 2.5.31, bison (GNU Bison)
2.1 and it seems to compile fine. If it works for you, please let me know
some details of your setup and I will add it to the documentation in the
file mentioned above. The url for my webpage is:
www.cs.rice.edu/~gulati

Thanks
Ajay

Subject: [Disksim-users] Per-process disk time
Message-ID: <f82da4e80704241005m7be2005dp3a3d4b5896567e18@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Disksim provides disk statistics data such as `Disk Transfer time
stats' and `Disk Access time stats', as described on page 42 of the
reference manual v3.0.

All these data are aggregated, i.e. time spent on disks for all
processes. Question: Does it provide per-process time disk time
statistics, as well? For e.g., disk time, or %age of disk time, spent
on process 1.

Thanks!

-Yipkei

No, it doesn't.

Thanks for the prompt response, Greg.

So, any suggestion on how to implement this additional feature?

Thanks.

No specific suggestion... information about process ID would need to
be propagated with every request and then lower level components would
need to keep separate per-process statistics.  Not going to be trivial,
but certainly not impossible either.

Good luck!

Subject: [Disksim-users] FIFO replacement in the smart controller
Message-ID: <997795.59002.qm@web55109.mail.re4.yahoo.com>

Hello,

Although page 22 of the manual mentions "FIFO" as a choice for the replacement policy for caches in a smart controller, I'd like to know whether this part has been completely implemented in the latest version of DiskSim. It appears that once the cache is full, lines do not get replaced under the FIFO policy. Whoever confirms or denies this receives my most sincere thanks.

-Sue Doughnum.

The person who wrote that code did it so long ago that he can't verify
that it still works.  So many years later, it wouldn't shock me to learn
that it doesn't work correctly, but I also doubt that that code changed
much (at all?) since it was originally written.

Sorry I couldn't be more definitive.

Thanks. I'd go further and hazard a guess that there does not even exist any 
code within DiskSim that implements these (everything except LRU) 
policies although they can be "enabled" through the parameter file. 

Thanks again.

I'd suggest grepping the code for words like FIFO before drawing
that conclusion... there is definitely code there (in disksim_cachemem.c),
but I can't vouch for the implementation's correctness.

In fact, a careful reading of the code in disksim_cachemem.c does not reveal any such, let alone grepping.

Same here. When replacement policy is FIFO, and once the cache is
full, cache_replace_waitforline( ) is the fate of every request. It appears that the
cache stops functioning after that; perhaps cache_get_replace_startpoint( ) returns NULL for FIFO when the cache is full.

Here's some debugging output (cache size 640, FIFO):

Enter cache_get_block: opid 66, devno 1, blkno 160, bcount 8
==> disksim_cachemem.c(314): cachemem_get_cachetype (cache_def *cache)

Message-ID: <f82da4e80704292120l6303506aqd29bccd76b502300@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Currently, Disksim reports disk performance statistics such as access
time and transfer time in an aggregated manner, instead of in a
per-process basis.

I have modified Disksim so that per-process disk statistics could be
shown. However, the problem is that, even though the processes are
absolutely identical (except pid, of course), some processes generates
almost 3 times more requests than others, when internal synthesized
workload is used, while I believe that identical, or almost, number of
requests should be generated by each process.

Here is a brief description (w./ some details omitted) on how I implement it.

disksim_global.h
- create a new member in the structure ioreq_event

disksim_synthio.c: synthio_appendio()
- copy pid from process *procp to ioreq_event *new

disksim_diskctlr.c: disk_buffer_sector_done()
- extract pid from ioreq_event *curr
- then, pass the pid to disk_buffer_request_complete()
Note: the same for disk_got_remapped_sector()

disksim_ctlr.c: disk_buffer_request_complete()
- add the new parameter: int pid
- pass pid to disk_acctimestats()

disksim_disk.c: disk_acctimestats()
- add the new parameter: int pid

Here is the configuration of each process.
     disksim_synthgen { # generator 3
       Storage capacity per device  =  8224032,
       devices = [ org0 ],
       Blocking factor =  8,
       Probability of sequential access =  0.2,
       Probability of local access =  0.3,
       Probability of read access =  0.5,
       Probability of time-critical request =  0.1,
       Probability of time-limited request =  0.3,
       Time-limited think times  = [ normal, 30.0, 100.0  ],
       General inter-arrival times  = [ exponential, 0.0, 10.0  ],
       Sequential inter-arrival times  = [ exponential, 0.0, 10.0  ],
       Local inter-arrival times  = [ exponential, 0.0, 10.0  ],
       Local distances  = [ normal, 0.0, 40000.0  ],
       Sizes  = [ exponential, 0.0, 8.0  ]
     } # end of generator 3

System topology: RAID 0 with 4 disks.

Number of simulated processes: 4

Here are the results (results are repeatable):
1. "Number of I/O requests to generate = 20
process1: 3 requests, process 2: 5requests, process 3: 8requests,
process 4: 1 requests

2. "Number of I/O requests to generate = 30
process1: 6 reqs, process 2: 11 reqs, process 3: 16 reqs, process 4: 1 reqs

3. "Number of I/O requests to generate = 40
process1: 9 reqs, process 2: 22 reqs, process 3: 31 reqs, process 4: 3 reqs

4. "Number of I/O requests to generate = 1000
process1: 132 reqs, process 2: 237 reqs, process 3: 399 reqs, process
4: 112 reqs

5. "Number of I/O requests to generate = 100000
process1: 13544 reqs, process 2: 22985 reqs, process 3: 38455 reqs,
process 4: 11420 reqs

My questions are:
1. Am I doing it in a right way? Or, is there any better way?
2. Does anyone encounter the same problem?
3. How can I fix it? Any suggestion?

Thanks!

That I know of, no effort was ever put into ensuring fairness among
synthetic workload generators in DiskSim, so it would not surprise
me if the scheduler were not fair.  I don't remember what it does,
off hand.

Subject: [Disksim-users] code questions ...
Message-ID: <1185986207.9144.128.camel@localhost>

Hi guys,

	Reading through the disksim code, I have a few questions & comments to
add to my previous questions.

	* src/syssym_driver.c (main)
		+ int len = 8192000;
		+ why do we allocate a structure that is 8Mb large 
		  instead of sizeof (disksim_t) ?

	* src/disksim.c (disksim_initialize_disksim_structure):
		+ perhaps related, why do we initialize fields:
			disksim->startaddr = addr;
			disksim->curroffset = sizeof(disksim_t);
		+ when (apparently) both are unused
		+ (also why a 'rr' in curroffset ? ;-)

	* src/disksim.c:
		+ disksim_t *disksim = NULL;
		+ why use a global variable for state ?

	* src/disksim_global.h

/* remapping #defines for some of the variables in disksim_t */
#define warmuptime       (disksim->warmuptime)
#define simtime	         (disksim->simtime)
#define statdeffile      (disksim->statdeffile)

		+ I assume these were to help move from lots of
		  global variables, to just one which is a good
		  direction.
		+ OTOH - can we change the field names, to be different
		  to the macro names ? :-) that would make the more
		  readable:
			disksim->_simtime;
		  actually compile.
		+ cf. disksim_initialize_disksim_structure
			+ simtime = 0.0;	/* gets remapped to disksim->warmuptime */

	* What namespacing policy is in use ?
		+ eg. gtk+ would always use a gtk_ prefix for all
		  exported symbols, GTK_ for macros, and Gtk for types
		+ does disksim have a policy ?

	* src/syssim_driver.c (syssim_deschedule_callback)
		+ comment: "de-scehdule a callback." is jumbled.

	* src/disksim_interface.c (disksim_interface_request_arrive)
		+ looks like the end of this is a cut/paste of
			+ disksim_interface_internal_event
		+ code shrink & cleanup possible :-)

	* src/disksim_global.h (ioreq_event)
		+ the 'void *buf' pointer here appears to be some
		  user closure; thus is 'buf' a good name ?

	* src/disksim.c (disksim_setup_disksim)
		+ I'm intrigued by code such as:
		  disksim->tracepipes[0] = 8; 
		  disksim->tracepipes[1] = 9; 
		+ why 8 & 9 ? :-) is socketpair what is required ?
		+ also the great block of commented out code appears
		  to betray a lack of revision-control based 
		  confidence in recovering old code ? :-)

	I suppose I've managed to create a wrapper API I can use now to drive
my I/O simulation (and wrapped that with a pinvoke / C# API ;-) and life
is good.

	Is there a process for getting changes / fixes into DiskSim ?

	Thanks,

		Michael.

Subject: [Disksim-users] patch: DISKSIM_PATH ...
Message-ID: <1186393511.5561.72.camel@localhost>

Hi guys,

	Since I'm embedding disksim as a shared library for (hopefully)
user-friendly application, there are several changes necessary. Perhaps
the simplest & most useful is attached. Instead of just looking for
files in the CWD, use a DISKSIM_PATH environment variable to try harder.

	I also managed to answer my question wrt:

                  disksim->tracepipes[0] = 8; 
                  disksim->tracepipes[1] = 9; 

	'8' is the first free file descriptor you get to after fopen-ing (and
never closing) the configuration files ;->

	I also, rather want to turn off all logging to files; would a patch be
accepted to use 'NULL' to signify no file output etc.

	Regards,

		Michael.

Subject: [Disksim-users] patch: improved (?) interface ...
Message-ID: <1186394482.5561.87.camel@localhost>

Hi there,

        My requirements for disk-sim, are (perhaps) rather unlike other
people's: treating it as a black-box, I plug a disk model in one end,
and wish to get a set of timing information out of the other end.

        Anyhow, I looked at the disksim_interface.[ch] code, and decided
to write a simple new API to cover my use-case at least:

        features:
                a) callback based => suitable for a shared library.
                b) fully opaque types:
                        + extremely extensible without ABI issues
                        + better self documenting behaviour
                c) no implicit state
                        + API has no global-variable requirements,
                          should be thread-safe in future etc.
                d) full closure information
                        + critical for propagating d) to the caller,
                          and allow alternate language bindings
                e) namespaced: I used 'IDiskSim', suggestions welcome.

        In particular I like properties c & d); which should support (I
hope) what I presume is an ongoing movement of the code away from global
state.

	[ Unfortunately the mailing list doesn't like my patch as an
attachment, so I append it ;-]

        Thanks,
        
                Michael.

Subject: [Disksim-users] A bug about "iosim Block"
Message-ID: <1186594726.46b9ffa61416f@webmail.mail.rice.edu>


Hello everyone :

DiskSim has a "iosim Block" in .parv file to support I/O trace time scale and
I/O mappings, et.

Users can set "I/O trace time scale" value in "iosim block" to replay the trace
in different speed, resulting different request rate. However, I found that the
value I set is not used by DiskSim. Then I dig into the source code.

I found in disksim_iosim.c :

void iosim_initialize_iosim_info ()
{
   disksim->iosim_info = DISKSIM_malloc (sizeof(iosim_info_t));
   bzero ((char *)disksim->iosim_info, sizeof(iosim_info_t));

   /* initializations that get remapped into iosim_info */
   ioscale = 1.0;    /**************LOOK HERE************/
   last_request_arrive = 0.0;
   constintarrtime = 0.0;
}


It means that "ioscale" is set to 1.0 by DiskSim, resulting the same speed as
the original trace, ignoring the value set by user in .parv file. And this value
is not changed in other places. I tried to change the value of "ioscale" in the
source code, then it works. For example, ioscale = 2, will make the arrival
time two times.

I found DiskSim did not read the parameter file to fill this "ioscale". So, no
matter what you set for I/O trace time scale, it just use the "1.0"  in the
runtime.

Does anyone else find this problem? I appreciate your suggestion and comments .

Hi Lanyue,
Not sure if you already looked at this. The following function in
disksim_iosim.c should read the parameter.

try printing in this function after the "#include ...." line to see if
correct value is loaded.


    424 static int iosim_load_map(struct lp_block *b, int n) {
    425   int c;
    426   int i = 0;
    427   char *s = 0;
    428
    429
    430 #include "modules/disksim_iomap_param.c"
    431
    432
Most of the setting of parameters is done via code in modules
sub-directory and may not be visible in src/ by using "grep". So I
would suggest giving it a try.
You can look at modules/disksim_iomap_param.c to see if the parameter
is loaded correctly.

Hi, Ajay :

Thanks a lot for your reply and suggestion !

There are two files in "modules" directory to handle the "iosim Block",
modules/disksim_iosim_param.c, and modules/disksim_iomap_param.c.
Both of them do not initialize the "ioscale", they only initialize the
io mappings variables, such as tracedev, simdev, locScale, et..

I print "ioscale" in functions "iosim_load_map" and "disksim_iomap_loadparams"
in file "disksim_iosim.c", the value is still "1.0", not the value I input in
.parv file.

Maybe I miss something, but during runtime, the value is always "1.0". I assume
that DiskSim miss to load this value.

Thanks,

Lanyue Lu

Subject: [Disksim-users] Throughput of disk 
Message-ID: <013501c7dc57$180ba3f0$4fb87680@genikims>

Dear all, 

I'm trying to increase the density of the disk drive. I just changed 
the values of number of blocks per track on the disk spec file. 
Since I increase the density of the disk drive, I was expecting the 
disk throughput increasing. But it was not. How can I do this? 

Is there anybody who can increase the maximum throughput of the 
disk drive not by changing the rpm or seek time but by increasing 
the density? 

Best regards, 
Youngjae

Hello,

Before I post a message about throughput.

You can change three variables :

"Read block transfer time, and Write block transfer time" in "Buses"
configuration block.

"Bulk sector transfer time" in "Controllers" configuration block.

"Bulk sector transfer time" in "**.diskspecs" file.

The minimum of them determines the throughput of the disk, you can have
a try.

Dear all,

How can we measure the maximum throughput of a disk dirve model with the 
synthetic workload generator? Just doing by increasing the request size 
enough and small enough inter-arrival time and measuring "total size of 
request processed / time"? Is there something easy else? Thanks.

Are you talking about streaming throughput?  If you use the trace
generator, you'll probably get a lot of random IOs... It seems like it
would be easy to make up purely sequential trace (start reading from
lbn 0) and see how long it takes...

Hi,all

I am a newer to disksim.
I compiled the disksim3.0 in my redhat linux. The version is Linux 2.4.20-8.
But when excute the command line as :
# ./disksim ascii.parv stdout ascii ascii.trace 0
Then it aborted at the end of the execution with the following message: 

assertion failed: in disksim_global_loadparams() (modules/disksim_global_param.c;138): statdeffile !=0: failed to open statdefs file!
 				
Is there something wrong about what I do? The diskspec file I use is the default: hp_c2249a.diskspecs.

Waiting for help. Thank you!

Hi Disksimers,
   
  I would like to ask a question regarding ?disksim interface.c?.
  when using Disksim as an external simulator, can I
  perform "disksim initialize" sevral times to perform sevral diffrent experiments,
  with no danger of previus experiment state to effect the next experiment?
  (I do pefrorm "disksim shutdown" at the end of each experiment)

Subject: [Disksim-users] Write throughput
Message-ID: <002501c7e648$c96016e0$0202fea9@genikims>

Dear all,

I tested write/read throughput with Barracuda disk (barracuda.diskspecs, 
barracuda.parv) for synthetic workloads. The configuration for my test and 
results are as follows.

1. Config.

I varied sequentiality (0-1). Inter-arrival time is set to be very small 
enough to fill up the queue all the time. The request size is 8 blocks 
(8*512=4KB). I tested every case till the program is aborted because of 
queue filled up.

2. Results

Regardless of sequentiality, write throughputs are almost the same. I don't 
know why this happens. IOPS is around 100. However, the read throughput 
varies according to the sequentiality, from 100 to 200.

Do you have any idea of why write throughput is smaller than read throughput 
and why write throughput does not change with the sequentiality of the 
workloads? And in the implementation, is there any additional overhead to 
the writes different from read ones?

Thank you.
YJ,

Hi Youngjae,

There are several write-related parameters in the diskspecs file.

e.g.
- Fast write level (i.e. write-back caching)
- Combine seq writes
- ... ...

Do they give some hints? I hope it helps.

Subject: [Disksim-users] simple disk approximation ...
Message-ID: <1188033364.4285.4.camel@localhost>

Hi guys,

	This is prolly a really lame question; but perhaps someone kind will
help out :-)

	I have a need for a very approximate disk simulator; ie. something that
behaves in a way that approximates some sort of disk, pretty much any
disk would be fine - but it needs to be larger than 9Gb :-) [ preferably
variable sized "today I want a 150Gb disk" or whatever ].

	The reason is that I wish to overlay a file-system snapshot over the
disk, and all my live file-systems are > 9Gb (apparently the
largest .parv available in valid/).

	Would simply tweaking valid/synthsimpledisk.parv achieve this ? if so a
few queries:

	* why this duplication:

disksim_simpledisk SD0 {
     Block count =  100000,
..
Generators = [
disksim_synthgen { # generator 0 
   Storage capacity per device  =  100000,

	* and would setting both of these to a far larger
	  number suffice ?

	* In my 'Generators' section, I have 4x cut/paste copies
	  of:

	disksim_synthgen { # generator 0 

	each marked 'generator 0' - is this really necessary ?

	Thanks,

		Michael.

Dear Yipkei

Thanks for your help. But I used fast writes and combined seq. writes and so on. But the throughputs of writes and reads wouldn't be the similar. The writes are slower than the reads in the throughput. They should be almost the same. Shouldn't they? 

Thanks.

Disk specs can be created by manipulating the parameters, as described
in the manual.  The "duplication" you mention relates to two independent
regions of parameters: one relates to the disk model and the other to
the synthetic workload generator.

Good luck,

Greg

Hi, Youngjae :

Write usually is slower than read, if you use write through, not write back.
Even you use write back, if the request rate is too high, the cache is always
filled up and the write is still slower than read. You can set up a simple
experiment to have a try in DiskSim.

Thus the throughput of read is higher than write. You can see that the company
usually use the read throughput of the disk as the maximum throughput, not
write throughput.

So, I think that it makes sense that the write throughput is smaller than read.

Subject: [Disksim-users] Problem About the on-board Cache 
Message-ID: <200708270926412036072@163.com>

Hi,
I am confused about the on-board cache in disk.  What I mean is not the cache in the controller but the on-board cache in disk.
For example the SEAGATE ST39102LW disk has 1MB on-board buffer while 840KB (also 4MB opertional will 3700KB used) is used for data caching as well as for speedmatching between the bus and the disk media. But the on board cache config parameters is only as a part of disk config. The flush policy and others parameters are not included. While in the reference manual the "3.4.9 Memory Caches" is only for the Controller type, isn't it?    

How can I config my on-board cache except the parameters that in the disk config (in the "3.4.5 Disks" Number of buffer segments, Enable caching in buffer and so on..). Such as flush policy as in the "Memory Caches".

Thank you very much!

Hi,
More I want to know is the source code.
There is disksim_cache.c, disksim_cachedev.c, disksim_cachemem.c, disksim_diskcache.c. What's the relationship between them.
For example the disksim_cachedev.c is used to cache a device with another device. But the others?

In the valid directory there is no disksim_cachemem setting example. Can you give me such a example?

As said in the reference manual the disk block cache is only used in the intelligent controller. But in the PhD thesis "System-oriented evaluation of I/O subsystem performance" included one sentence "The disk drive module includes a separate cache/buffer submodule because of the specialized nature of common on-board disk cache management policies."(at the bottom line of the page 105). Does that to say there is a separate on-board cache implemente in the source code? 

Thank you very much.

Hi,
Sorry for that I forget to post it in the mailing list.

But how can I config the parameters of the on-board disk cache. Are they in the config of disk as showed in the "3.4.5 Disks" of the reference manual. Or some are not included in the  "3.4.5 Disks"  configed in the source code of disksim_diskcache.c?

More ever there is no data indeed keeped in the disksim. So if I want to keep the data content I should to keep a buffer to contain them?  Also the trace used are only request size, arrive time and so on.. Disksim is mainly used for performance test. Can I run an application upon it? 

Thank you !

It sounds like you need to cozy up to the manual.  If memory serves,
it describes the parameters of the on-board disk cache module.  It
also explains that disksim is only a performance simulator.

Hi,

Sorry I don't catch your meaning.

What I want to do is changing the on-board cache structure. So I will extend the disksim_diskcache.c.
But some parameters I don't know how to config it such as the flush policy etc. Does the on-board cache parameters are all configered in the disk parameters?

Please forgive my uninterrupted bother and untalented.
Thank you very much.

I couldn't compile even with GCC 2.95.3. I had to make some changes in
the code. With the attached patch, I can compile disksim with gcc
2.95.3, 3.4.5, and 4.1.2

Message-ID: <200708282112324531465@163.com>

Hi,

I am trying to use the disksim as following:

#./disksim cheetah9LP.parm File_out validate cheetah9LP.trace 1

The last parameter "1" indicate that I using the synthetic workload which has been configured in the cheetah9LP.parm.
But after I run then it aborted as following:

#./disksim cheetah9LP.parm File_out validate cheetah9LP.trace 1

Assertion failed:
simtime = 55.871283
totalreqs      =12
disksim: disksim_pfsim.c:290: pf_io_done_notify: Assertion 'tmp->next != ((void *)0)' failed
   Aborted

I also checked the line 290 in the disksim_pfsim.c. But I don't know why.
Can someone tell me. And tell me how to use the synthetic workload. An example should appreciate. Thank you!

BTW: Following Code,

if (disk_printhack && (simtime >= disk_printhacktime)) {
fprintf (outputfile, "%12.6f            Entering disk_buffer_reusable_segment_check\n",simtime);
fflush(outputfile);
}

Where can I see the output file? It's not in the  "File_out" file as what I do above.

Hi, All

I am really confused with the synthetic workload generator.
Can some one tell me how to use it?

Following is my command but failed.
#./disksim cheetah9LP.parm File_out validate cheetah9LP.trace 1

Thank you very much!

Hi,
Well I have choose to command as:
./disksim cheetah9LP.parv file raw hp_c2247a.trace 2
Problem didn't appear.
Really I don't know why although there is no problem anymore? 

But one thing I am surprised is that when I set the "Number of buffer segments" larger, there is no increasing in the "disk Buffer hit ratio". I think is the cache manage problem in the diskcache.

Does the real diskcache do as that in disksim?

Thank you!

Hi,

Just need to change the trace format from validate to ascii.

#./disksim cheetah9LP.parm cheetah9LP.outv ascii cheetah9LP.trace 1

File_out is just the name of your output file, can be any file you want.
The example above is : cheetah9LP.outv.

This can work.

Hi, Thank you very much.

Yes, it does work. I try that with raw format and success.
But the outputfile is not including the message what I want. 

> if (disk_printhack && (simtime >= disk_printhacktime)) {
> fprintf (outputfile, "%12.6f            Entering

> fflush(outputfile);

For example the message of "*** Entering disk_buffer_reusable_segment_check " is not included in the outputfile.
But it is the trace message in the source code which I want to track these message.

Thank you all the same!

Hi,

Just  need  to  change  the  trace  format  from  validate  to  ascii.

#./disksim  cheetah9LP.parm  cheetah9LP.outv  ascii  cheetah9LP.trace  1

File_out  is  just  the  name  of  your  output  file,  can  be  any  file  you  want.
The  example  above  is  :  cheetah9LP.outv.

are there any known issues compiling DiskSim on a 64bit PC?
should there be any problem at all?
I will be glad to hear if anybody compiled DiskSim on his 64bit PC, and in detail, ubuntu 64bit.

Dear DiskSim users,

We have been using NS - 2 (Network Simulator - 2) for simulating iSCSI
application. We now have to use a storage (disk) simulator which can accept
trace - file from ns-2 and give appropriate output, indicating how disk(s)
has been used.  Please, direct us as to how DiskSim can be used for this.
Also, please give alternatives of DiskSim which we can use.

Dear Smita,
To the best of my knowledge, DiskSim from CMU is the best candidate for your need. In the meanwhile, there is a toolkit for simulating storage networks, called SANsim.
At least, I know a paper introduces it. I think you can find it from Internet.
good luck.

AFAICT, disksim accepts disk trace file format from HP. It's a simple, 
line based ASCII format, which looks simple and quite understandable. 
Have a look at the different valid/*.trace files.

Subject: [Disksim-users] rotational delay
Message-ID: <e768b283e104.476020b5@wiscmail.wisc.edu>

Hi,

I'm using disksim to try and find the rotational latency writes incur with different disks and scheduling algorithms. I found that there were two functions which were used for this,  device_get_servtime and device_get_seektime. While the latter is self-explanatory that it finds seek delay, I'm not able to understand how does device_get_servtime find the rotational delay? Also there's another function device_get_acctime which I think has not been completely written in the version i have. Would really appreciate if you could tell me how device_get_servtime finds rotational delay or is it a sum of seeks and rotational latency?

Thanks.

Mayank.

Subject: [Disksim-users] adding RAID6 to disksim
Message-ID: <398451.49404.qm@web55208.mail.re4.yahoo.com>

Hi there all. I am attempting to add RAID6 to disksim, and I have tried to simply copy the parity_rotated code into a subroutine which I named after RAID6. When I try to run even this, I get an error which tells me "unknown maptype at logorg_RDP - 4" even though I never changed the mapping type. Has anyone else tried to do something similar to this that could lend me some advice about what the error might be?
Thanks,
Mike

Message-ID: <f82da4e80702251900r4ae3c693i3d23c2e69002b638@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is there any developer's guide for disksim which talks about the I/O
queue structure used for scheduling.

In the file disksim_ioqueue.c, the queue structure is not that
understandable. For example, the iob structure pointed by queue->list
is not the head of the queue but queue->list->next. Also, sometimes,
but not always, the next pointers of some iob structures on a queue is
actually pointing back to itself.

Can anyone explain the queue structure used in Disksim, especially in
the file disksim_ioqueue.c? Or, even better, is there any developer's
manual for disksim?

Thank you very much!

Regards,
Yipkei

Unfortunately, there is no developer's manual or additional documentation
beyond the user guide.

Good luck!

Hello,Greg Ganger,
    Disksim 3.0 is a great job, but it has some limitations. I wonder when disksime 4.0 will come out? Maybe some months later?    

All the best.

Not sure.  Hoping to put something new out in the next couple of months,
but you should not expect a great many limitations to disappear...

Disksim developers,
   
  I would like to encourage you
to publish a new version of the program.
disksim is unique and supports the 
research community in the filed of storage.
I think a new version should include more
updated storage devices then offered in version 3.0.
perhaps a new version will solve portability and compatibility issues
(such as the need for gcc 2.95, and old flex(?) )
and therefore enable more developers and researchers
who are less proficient to use this valuable tool.
   
  many thanks
and much appreciation,
Shay Raz

I believe that the README file in the topmost directory of the tarball
explains making and testing that it worked.

Subject: [Disksim-users] Disksim-3.0 fix
Message-ID: <45B927B7.40201@utep.edu>

To get disksim-3.0 compiled on our 32-bit fedora system, we had to
remove '/n' from line 319 in libparam/mod.pl:

fprintf(stderr, \"*** error: in $MODNAME spec -- missing required
parameter \\\"%s\\\"\n\", $aname"."[c].name);

becomes:

fprintf(stderr, \"*** error: in $MODNAME spec -- missing required
parameter \\\"%s\\\"\", $aname"."[c].name);

Also tried to compile it on a 64-bit SuSE 10.1 system, but that gives
lot of compile errors (unknown size for data types, excess elements in
structs, etc). Will try to look into that. Did anybody manage to compile
disksim on a 64-bit SuSE 10.1 system?

Cheers
Andre

I then tried compiling on a machine running CentOS 4.4 with gcc 3.4.6.

Subject: [Disksim-users] Data layout and control flow in disksim
Message-ID: <4692641D.1040901@cs.cornell.edu>

Hi,

I'm trying to simulate a log-structured storage system using disksim. 
Could you give me pointers on how to go about this? I couldn't find 
implementation details about the layout module anywhere (yes, I realize 
that the code *is* the documentation sometimes :-) ). Some things that I 
want to find out:
1. How do I set the size of a block?
2. How do I alter the lbn-to-pbn mapping?

It would also be really helpful if someone could take me through the 
steps of how a single read or write access is processed by disksim. I've 
step-ed my way through several runs to try to understand the control 
flow, but I'm still hazy on the big picture.

Thank you!

Subject: [Disksim-users] patch to DiskSim-3.0 to build with recent gcc's ...
Message-ID: <1184099067.6397.128.camel@localhost>

So,

	I hope patches are welcome to DiskSim; I had some problems building it
on a recent Linux system, and not wanting to go back to some ancient
compiler - and, given that most of the new gcc errors are
sub-optimalities in the code - I though a patch might be appreciated.

	Also, out of interest - to avoid duplicating work; is there a revision
control system in use for DiskSim ? I would recommend 'git' of course -
if there are setup problems with that: git only requires a single shell
account with a ~/public_html directory.

	It'd also be nice to get some idea of the "live-ness" of this project
(before I dive in too far), how actively is DiskSim maintained &
developed ?

	Thanks guys,

		Michael.

Subject: [Disksim-users] The maximum throughput of disk in DiskSim
Message-ID: <1184365910.4697fd561e9b0@webmail.mail.rice.edu>


Hi everyone :

Recently, I try to find the maximum throughput of a certain kind of disk.
However, for one kind of disk model, like Cheetah 9LP, which is included in
DiskSim, there are different kinds of interface for it, leading to different
inter transfer rate and different maximum throughput.

For Cheetah 9LP,
if you use SCSI interface, the maximum transfer rate is 5MB/s.
if you use Ultra2 SCSI interface, the maximum transfer rate is 40MB/s.

I did not find how I can configure the interface for the disk model. At the same
time, there are three interesting parameters which may affect the throughput of
disk :
"bulk sector transfer time" in **.diskspecs file,
"Read / Write block transfer time" of Bus in **.parv file,
"Bulk sector transfer time" of Controller in **.parv file.

I think the max of the three time will determine the maximum throughput of disk.
For example, DiskSim default set the maximum value of them is 0.1ms, so the
maximum throughput is 512B/0.1ms = 5MB/s. It seems like DiskSim simulate SCSI
interface, however, if I want to simulate the Ulrta2 SCSI interface to get
higher throughput, how I can configure it ? Just change the three time value ??

Is there anybody who has some ideas about this issue ?

Thanks a lot for your comments and suggestions !

Yes, the times can simply be changed to correspond to the appropriate
bus speed.

Hello.

1) Does segmented LRU work correctly, i.e., has it been fully implemented?

2) Suppose two segments are desired. What should the parts pertinent to SLRU in the parameter file look like?

Thanks.

Does anybody know of a source code release for DiskSim that adds power
models?  I have read a 2003 paper that describes a release called
Dempsey, but I have been unable to find a download.  I have had no
success contacting the authors.

Thanks!

Thanks a million!  If I can get it working for Disksim 3.0, I'll try
to get a patch back to the mailing list.

Hi,

In DiskSim 3.0, is there any diskmodel supporting TCQ (Tagged Command
Queuing) or NCQ (Native Command Queuing)?

Where can I download diskmodel files for disks supporting TCQ or NCQ?

Here is the list of disks supporting TCQ and NCQ.
TCQ:
Western Digital Raptor WD 740GD
NCQ:
Seagate Barracuda 7200.7 ST3160827AS
Seagate Barracuda 7200.7 ST3120827AS
Seagate Barracuda 7200.7 ST380817AS
Seagate Barracuda 7200.7 ST3250823AS
Seagate Barracuda 7200.7 ST3300831AS
Seagate Barracuda 7200.7 ST3400832AS 3.01
Seagate Barracuda 7200.7 ST3200822AS 3.01
Maxtor  DiamondMax 10     6B300S0
Maxtor  DiamondMax 10     6B250S0

Thank you very much!

Hi Ming,

It might be the problem with the compiler version.

Check this out!

parameters for modifying disk queue depths and scheduling algorithms are
listed in the User Guide.  I don't remember which disk models that were
included allow for command queueing, but I wouldn't be surprised if all
did.  (The simulator doesn't differentiate tagged vs. native, in terms
of real-world mechanism for achieving the same basic end.)

	Which may be fixed by my patch:

https://sos.ece.cmu.edu/pipermail/disksim-users/2007-July/000168.html

	As yet un-replied to AFAICS ;-)

	OTOH - though it now compiles cleanly, and all the fixes were obvious
in one way or another; I've as yet to hook DiskSim up and test it live;
so YMMV.

	If I get no response wrt. the patch inclusion process, I guess I'll
just check it into a git/ repository somewhere and post a link to that.

	HTH,

		Michael.

Hi,

I saw there was VC work space and tried to compile Disksim 3.0 and got lots of errors.  Can Disksim 3.0 be compiled using VC++ 2005 Express Edition? Thanks.

That msvc file is very old and has not been maintained.  Someone is
going to contribute a new setup for this.  In the meantime, I am not
aware of any reason that this would be particularly difficult to do,
but won't be able to help much if you want to try to do it yourself as
I have no experience with msvc.

We have a new release that is almost done that will include models for
new disks like Seagate Cheetah15k4, etc.  We will post an announcement
here when it's available.

Hi,
Is there any available code which we can refer for getting more idea about
'How to write a parameter file and output file' , so that we will be able to
write a code for that.

You generally shouldn't write one from scratch;  look in the valid/
subdirectory of the distribution for many examples.

Checkout this database of disksim parameter files some commonly modelled
disks.  Its unlikely you would want to write an entirely new parameter file,
so if there are just a few parameters you want to adjust I would simply
duplicate one of these parameter files and make the appropriate changes.  If
there is a specific disk you want to create a parameter file for you can try
using DIXtrac, I'm not familiar with it but it basically extracts the
parameters of a real disk which you can use to create a config file for
disksim.

As for the output file, you do not write these.  The output file simply
contains the statistics of the execution of the simulator on a given
parameter file.  The output file gives you the results of your simulation,
so disksim will be the only one that writes to this file.

Earlier you asked how to run disksim, there is an example in the
documentation in section 2.2.

Hope this helps.

yes we tried but we are facing a comment like"*parameter file overrides must
be 3-tuples" *

in command prompt we are using the follwing command :

"*disksim cheetah9LP.parv cheetah9LP.runvalid valid/ascii.trace
src/disksim_global.h  0 "disk0 .. disk17""

Message-ID: <a9c006350703030414oaa05833h8841ca3dfb3f3967@mail.gmail.com>

i saw the 'database of the disksim parameter files' . can i run directly the
'diskname.runvalid' ? i tried one disk using this command. But it is giving
me an error 'command not found' .
I also saw the examples given in the valid directory. But i m still confused
with final output that i will get after running the 'disksim' command.
Uptil now i understood that, my i/p file will  have '.parv' , o/p file will
have '.outv' extention, trace file will have '.trace' extention.But what
about other command line parameters?

Thanks & regards,
Shubhada

Yes,  because you included "disk0 .. disk17".  See disksim by default
requires only 5 parameters.  If you add more then they must be in multiples
of three (3-tuples).  These 3-tuples are meant to easily change parameters
already defined in the parameter file.  You will probably not want to do
this.

Second the first 5 parameters you are using are not correct.  To run disksim
you need to enter this at the terminal:

diskim <parameter file> <output file> <trace type> <trace file> <synthethic
generation flag>

where, <parameter file> is a file which contains properly formatted
parameters for disksim
<output file> is a file (which may or may not exist) where disksim can dump
the statistics
<trace type> tells disksim what format the trace is in
<trace file> a file containing properly formatted trace of disk requests (in
<trace type> format)
<synthetic generation flag> is set to 1 if you will manually generate the
disk requests.  (this is usually set to zero since you have a trace file)

With all that the proper way to execute disksim would be:

*disksim cheetah9LP.parv cheetah9LP.out validate cheetah9LP.trace  0

This will execute disksim with the cheetah9LP parameter file, and the
statistics can be found in a file called cheetah9LP.out when the simulation
is complete, and the simulation executed on a trace found in
cheetah9LP.trace which is formatted in the validate type.  Finally no
synthetic generation was used.

Once the simulation is complete go and view cheetah9LP.out to see the
results of the simulation.

Make sure you have a statdefs file in the directory where you're
running disksim.  The path to the statdefs file is defined in the parv
file.  You should be able to find an example statdefs file in the
disksim/valid directory.

 HI,
We wanted to know the *contents of trace file*.We can see inside some

Subject: [Disksim-users] Does DiskSim support disk array
	reconstruction/rebuild?
Message-ID: <BAY106-W20CFD83F0A55E561ECD541D77A0@phx.gbl>

Hello Disksim user community,
 
I am working on a project and I would like to use Disksim to simulate my algorithms. But I am not sure if the Disksim supports what I am trying to do.
 
Does Disksim support disk array reconstruction simulations? Let's say I have RAID5 array with five disks. In case of hard disk failure, I need to simulate the disk rebuilding process while serving I/O requests. The reconstruction time need to be calculated and the drawback to the I/O performance needs to be counted as well. 
 
I would appreciate if anyone could give me an answer, together with a brief hint on how to accomplish that. Thanks.
 
Jack

No, Disksim does not support its own rebuild.  You would have to
generate this workload yourself.  I would do this by simulating an
5-disk array with no redundancy, generating simultaneous reads from
the four non-failed disks, adding in some think time to simulate
re-building the data from parity, then issuing writes to the fifth
disk.  While this is running, you could run some foreground requests
as well.  You could do this pretty easily by writing a program that
uses the disksim_interface to issue your requests to the disk and
drive the simulator - see the syssim program as an example of how to
use disksim_interface.

You'll want to set the "Scheduling policy" parameter;  details are in
the manual.

Hi,

     Could someone help in the following issue?

     If I want to run traces generated for a disk that is not present in 
'valid' directory, How should i generate .parv, .seek, .model and 
.diskspecs files for that disk?

I got the traces on a solaris machine. On linux machine, we could know the 
geometry and some other parameters using 'hdparm'. Is there any equivalent 
command in Solaris? (I didnt find any...)

Thanks and Regards,
Amareshwari

Hi

Generating configurations for new disks is the goal of another tool
called DIXtrac (http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/Dixtrac/index.html), which is
not currently available online, although we are hoping to make a
public release soon.  You can try to edit your configuration files to
reflect the parameters of another disk, but it will probably be tricky
to get it right.

Hi,

We are unable to understand the contents of output file.It is around 6000
lines.Is there any way by which we can get only the desired contents instead
of all the reapeated data that are already present in parv file & statdefs
file.Or is there any use of those contents.

Thanks and Regards,

These specify bins for the histograms which are output by DiskSim for
a particular statistic.  The statistic you've shown here is described
in section 5.2.2 of the DiskSim 2.0 manual.  The output is the
histogram of the VALIDATE Trace access diff time statistic.

Hi,

We have tried changing the "Scheduling Policy" in disksim_ioqueue in .parv
file.But we cannot see any difference in the output file.How should we make
changes so as to see the difference in the output file after changing the
"Scheduling Policy" in .parv file.

Message-ID: <f82da4e80705131431l52c78756vb607ff218abf9fc1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am running Disksim w./ a trace workload.

Problem:
The amount of "Total Requests handled" by the disk is less than the
number of requests specified in the trace.

I suspect that is because of request coalescence/overlapping/combining.

disksim_ioqueue: Overlapping request scheme
-----------------------------------------------------------
- We have already set this parameter 0 so that overlapping requests
are treated as independent.

disksim_disk: Combine seq writes
-------------------------------------------
- The default value of our HP C3323 hard drive is 1. We experienced
_exactly_ the same problem even when we set it to 0.

I/O Driver Statistics
-------------------------
>From the statistics, both "IOdriver Overlaps combined" and "IOdriver
Read overlaps combined" are both 0. So, no requests are combined on
the I/O driver level.


Is there any other level of the I/O hierarchy could cause request
coalescence? Or, are there some other reasons, other than request
coalescence, which cause the problem that I am facing?

Thank you very much!

-Yipkei

P.S. Here is our experimental setup.
I/O trace-driven
raid 0 - 1 HP C3323A hard drive.
(Originally, there are 4 disks in the RAID. For simplicity, now we
only use 1. So, strictly speaking, it's not a RAID.
Number of processors = 1

Cache hits would cause the number of requests at the disk to be less
than the number in the trace.  That's something to look at.

We found that the program would stop when it has the number of requests the
user asks for in the generating list which means some requests are still in
the queues in different places like in controller or disks waiting for the
service. So you will find in the result that "total number of requests
generated" is the number of requests you asked for but "the total number of
requests handled" is always less than "the total number of requests
generated".  Although I tested it using synchronous way but I think it
should work the same way with using trace.

Hi Ming,

In my case, I use trace workload, instead of synthetic workload. As my
understand, the parameter of "Number of I/O requests to generate" is
only applicable for synthetic workload, as it is a part of the
synthetic generation module configuration. Under trace workload, the
simulation should not terminate until the trace is exhausted. (please
let me know if I am wrong.)

Thanks!

Hi Greg and the Disksim community,

Thanks for the hint. I analyzed my experiment results right away.

However, the cache hits cannot justify the number of missing requests.
Here, I define the number of missing requests to be the difference
between number of requests specified in the trace and the number of
"Total Requests handled" by the Overall I/O System, IOdriver and Disk.

Here is some data. (Note: The result is obtained with a fresh Disksim
installation with validation test passed)

-- #(missing requests) = 92359 - 86339 = 6020
-- System logorg #0 disk Buffer hit ratio:          2879   0.033345
-- Disk Buffer hit ratio:          2879    0.033345

Note: 2879 is the hit count.

There is quite a distance between the number of missing requests
(6020) and the hit count (2879).

I am looking forward to hear from you. Thank you!

-Yipkei

P.S. I have some other questions about Disksim and I will send it in
another email.

Subject: [Disksim-users] Other problems that I have w./ Disksim
Message-ID: <f82da4e80705142128l591eee0egb6a39e5ecee00db2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Here are some other questions that I have w./ Disksim.

I discovered these questions under the following environment.
- trace workload
- 1 I/O driver, 1 sys logorg, 1 ctrl, RAID 0 of 1 disk (4 disks if specified)

1. Some requests in the trace not being delivered to the disk
As I am looking for a reason why the number of requests getting into
the disk is less than the number of requests specified in the trace, I
found that some requests specified in the trace are not actually being
delivered to the disk. To investigate the problem, I started from a
tiny problem set.

When there is/are only 1 or 2 request(s) in the trace, there is no
request being delivered to the disk. Finally, as I keep increasing the
number of requests, the "Total Request handled" count of the overall
I/O System and the Disk become 1 when there are 3 requests in the
trace. However, the buffer hit count is 0. So, it means that the
disappearance of the 2 requests is not because of cache hit. So, where
did they go?

2. Different values of "Overall I/O System Total Requests handled"
with the same trace but different RAID setup.

There are 92359 requests in our trace. If a RAID 0 of 1 disk is used,
the "Overall I/O System Total Requests handled" is 86339. However, if
a RAID 0 of 4 disks is used, the value of "Overall I/O System Total
Requests handled" increases to 92358. I would assume that the number
of requests handled should be independent of the number of disks in
the RAID. Did I make a wrong assumption, or did I miss something?
Also, I cannot find the definition of "Overall I/O System" from the
user manual. Could anyone help me with the definition please?

3. Swelling number of requests along the I/O hierarchy
I used a RAID 0 of 1 disk and the other one with 4 disks. I found
that, when only 1 disk is used, the values of "Total Requests handled"
of the "Overall I/O System", "Sys logorg", IOdriver" and Disk are the
same. But, when 4 disks are used, the values of "Total Requests
handled" of the last 3 are the same but that of the "Overall I/O
System" is less than the rest 3. How can we explain it?

Please see below for experimental results.
-- from statistical output of an unmodified Disksim installation
--- e.g. when 92359 requests are requested (RAID 0, 1 disk)
---- Overall I/O System Total Requests handled = 86339
---- Sys logorg #0 disk Total Requests handled = 86339
---- IOdriver Total Requests handled = 86339
---- Disk Total Requests handled = 86339

--- when 92359 requests are requested (RAID 0, 4 disk)
---- Overall I/O Subsystem Total Requests handled = 92358
---- Sys logorg #0 disk Total Requests handled = 105515
---- IOdriver Total Requests handled = 105515
----- IOdriver #0 device #0 Total Requests handled = 26042
----- IOdriver #0 device #1 Total Requests handled = 26557
----- IOdriver #0 device #2 Total Requests handled = 26504
----- IOdriver #0 device #3 Total Requests handled = 26412
---- Disk Total Requests handled = 105515
----- Disk #0 Total Requests handled = 26042
----- Disk #1 Total Requests handled = 26557
----- Disk #2 Total Requests handled = 26504
----- Disk #3 Total Requests handled = 26412

I am looking forward to hear from you. More experiment information
will be provided upon requested.

Thank you!

Regards,
Yipkei

Subject: [Disksim-users] Simulating multiple processes (applications) with
	trace-driven simulation
Message-ID: <f82da4e80705191909v13df0538kbce9cba653efee91@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

My goal is to simulating the I/O system activities under multiple
(simulated) application workloads. We have looked at the
synthetic-driven simulation and, now, we want to look at the
trace-driven simulation.

I have checked the format of the 3 types of traces: ascii, validate
and raw. None of them allows specifying the generating process
(application) of each request.

According to the user manual, at most 1 trace can be used for each run
of simulation. I am wondering if it is possible to supply n traces to
the simulation if I want to simulate n processes (applications). Or,
if it is possible to tag the process ID of the generating process to
each request in the trace.

Looking forward to hear from you. Thank you!

Regards,
Yipkei

I think the way I'd do this is use a lightweight threads package like
gnu pth or "state threads", run disksim in one thread through the
interface and model each of your processes with a separate thread.
You'd have to write the glue to synchronize all this but I wouldn't
think it would be more than 100 lines of code or so.

Message-ID: <f82da4e80705280929k10758dedicdbd96bf590cf2a0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Did anyone compile Disksim 3.0 on the AMD64 platform successfully? I
have problems when compiling Disksim 3.0 on my AMD64 machine.

Here is my brief machine configuration.

CPU: AMD64 (x86_64)
OS: Ubuntu 7.04
CC: gcc version 4.1.2 (Ubuntu 4.1.2-0ubuntu4)

Please see below for the screen dump.

Thank you!

Subject: [Disksim-users] Disksim compilation errors on AMD64

This looks like a gcc issue, not an amd64 issue; you need gcc-2.95
which there's probably an ubuntu package for that you can easily
install.  The new release (coming soon!) has this problem fixed.

Message-ID: <006701c81fb4$41c12350$6b280a0a@ictwangmin>

Hi,all:
     I'm going to run the system-level simulation with syssim_driver.c, but 
the response time is a negative value -39163.548316,   why? I have also read 
through the related code, but can't explain it.

    syssim: externally-controlled DiskSim (avg. resp should be about 19.6ms)
  response time: n=1000 average=-39163.548316 std. deviation=22560.393800
IOdriver Response time average:         19.561833

PS:  the command is : ../src/syssim  st41601n.parv  syssim.outv  2676846  0

hi, all:
     Maybe I didn't describe the question clearly. I run the runvalid script 
in DiskSim, and the last two validations are  about system-level simulation 
with DiskSim. I am confused on this results: IOdriver response time is 
19.56ms, but the total system response time is -39163.54.  Would you please 
explain it to me? Thank you very much.

The results is :
syssim: externally-controlled DiskSim (avg. resp should be about 19.6ms)
  response time: n=1000 average=-39163.548316 std. deviation=22560.393800
IOdriver Response time average:         19.561833

Subject: [Disksim-users] param file
Message-ID: <a3798109be62defaa686f871c85f00b8@i61797>

Hi all,
 
I have a question about param file.
I made a param file by 'vi editor' and I simulated a simple trace file.
But it just error message is printed that is [Error reading 'Byte Order:'].
Apparently, I inputted 'Little' at param file, nevertheless, for what reason printed this error message.
Is that wrong what form of my param file made? If so, how to make a param file?
Thanks alot!
 
Best,
YG

Message-ID: <8f9c6852edfb01c220e18d6ed0a5f1af@i61825>

Hi all,
 
Line 384 to 395 in Disksim.c, 
 
384 if (fscanf(parfile, "\nByte Order (Endian): %s\n", seed) != 1) {
385 fprintf(stderr, "Error reading 'Byte Order:'\n");
386 exit(0);
387 }
388 if (strcmp(seed, "Little") == 0) {
389 disksim->endian = _LITTLE_ENDIAN;
390 } else if (strcmp(seed, "Big") == 0) {
391 disksim->endian = _BIG_ENDIAN;
392 } else {
393 fprintf(stderr, "Invalid byte ordering scheme - %s\n", seed);
394 exit(0);
395 }
 
'Fscanf' scan a stored data at parfile. And then, it compare the string whether 'Little' or 'Big'.
Now, 'Little' is stored at 'parfile', but it happen error at line number of 385 . Error reading 'Byte Order:'.
I don't know why this error is happened.
I'll very appreciate of any advice.
 
Best regards,
YG

Subject: [Disksim-users] Controller Interface
Message-ID: <ea27c8da7cf4.4748984a@wiscmail.wisc.edu>

Hi,

I'm trying to locate the modules in the source code which schedules the
requests and passes the writes to the bus or the driver. Basic logical
hierarchy suggests that its the controller-driver-bus-disk . So if I want
to give more than one addresses to write to, will disksim be able to
handle that (there will have to be changes made) and which modules would
likely be needed to be hacked?

Mayank.

I don't understand the question, but I believe that the user manual
describes the hierarchy of components.

I understand the hierarchy and its given in the manual. What i was interested in was if I want to provide Disksim a certain range of addresses to write to instead of a single block number, where would the changes be required to make: in the controller or the IO driver. My guess is it should be somewhere in the controller...so I would wanna know where does the scheduling take place in the controller and if by making changes to the scheduler, could you achieve writes which are addressed to a range of physical addresses?

Depends on where you wanted it to happen.  Think of it like an actual
system, which could do that in any of several (or multiple) places.
For example, scheduling happens in many places -- scheduling parameters
can be provided for driver, controller, and disk (see manual).

Good luck,

Greg

Hi,

I'm wondering about the status of disksim. I've read quite some requests 
for data for newer drives - can somebody provide some? Is the CVS of 
disksim publicly accessible? Is there a new release planned?

Regards

I've just managed to compile the source under Linux. And I've some 
compiler warnings. I'd like to make disksim simpler to compile by 
introducing some sort of autoconf magic.

	This has already been done as part of iogrind, with a load of bug
fixes, 64bit fixes etc.

	See:

	http://live.gnome.org/iogrind/

	for the source download URL; I'd be happy to see someone maintaining
that ;-)

	HTH,

Thank you for that pointer, interesting project.

You don't mention disksim at all on your iogrind website. Why do you 
clam it's inaccurate, while disksim is said to be quite accurate? Did 
you drop certain capabilities of disksim or is this because of your 
broken 100Gb disk model?

Hi all,

Our group of CMU/PDL alumni are still trying to get a new disksim
release together;  we're just very busy with our day jobs and it's
been hard to make time to work on it.  I believe we're down to the
last one or two outstanding issues that need to be fixed before we can
ship so we may actually be able to get it done this month!

	That is a bug, please do fix the wiki page to add a link (I could have
sworn it was there, it's prominently mentioned in the source README
etc.).

	My 100Gb disk model, produced by tweaking the umpteen tweakables in
there. In the process of tweaking them, some pretty anomylous results
were generated, leading me to suspect some rather un-tested and
under-constrained validation of that file. Of course, my 100Gb disk is
all one zone (eg.) ;-)

	Of course, using the more simple disk models - such as constant seek
time data was not useful for what I wanted ... anyhow ;-) if someone
that really understands all the tweakables can produce a reasonable
model of a reasonably modern disk that'd be most helpful.

	Regards,

		Michael.

Hi?all

  When I use the cello99 trace file from HPL in DiskSIM, the error 
message is:



?Format problem with 'tracedate' line in HPL trace - tracedate = Mon 
Feb  1 12:00:00 1999?



The cello92 trace file is OK. Who can tell me how to modify the DiskSIM?

Subject: [Disksim-users] Make errors. Old compiler required?
Message-ID: <4706F31E.4090907@consultpros.com>

I am attempting my first compile of disksim 3.0.  It fails with plenty
of warnings and errors.  I found an email in the archive from more than
a year ago that states gcc 2.95 should be used to compile.

1. Is there a build "howto" or some other build guide?

2. Is an old version of gcc still required?

3. Is there an effort to bring the code base forward to current tools?

BTW, I am attempting to build on an OpenSUSE Linux 10.2 installation
using gcc 4.1.2.

Thanks.

(Answering myself...)

I did more digging in the email archive and found this message:

https://sos.ece.cmu.edu/pipermail/disksim-users/2007-August/000204.html

with an attached patch file.  After application the build was
successful, albeit with plenty of warnings.  The "runvalid" test was
successful too.

Perhaps this message should be referenced on the home page until the
patch is properly integrated?

Asking Disksim users to step back to the 2.95 version of GCC is a bit
odd, in my opinion.  Being new to the program I know little of it's
history.  Perhaps someone can fill me in on the situation.

1. Is there a technical reason or difficulty that has prevent the port
forward?

2. Is there a known requirement to stay back on the older compiler?

3. What is the patch submission method if one were to solve this issue?

	:-) DiskSim is unmaintained (unfortunately).

> forward?

	Nope; nothing I'm aware of.

	If you go to http://live.gnome.org/iogrind and look at 'getting the
code' - you can download a version of disksim-3.0 embedded into iogrind
with a number of bug fixes, autoconf-isation, that will build ~without
warnings on a recent SUSE. Do feel free to rip it out of there for your
own use :-)

	HTH,

If memory serves, that is an internal type used to represent certain of
the specifiable redundancy scheme types (those that have non-trivial
repeating patterns).

hmm, should be pretty obvious in following the types (like PARITY_TABLE)
that you've already found in the code.  The array activities start in
disksim_logorg.c.

Good luck!

It relates to checkpointing functionality in DiskSim.  I would not suggest
relying on it.

Hmm ... that assert is new to me.  There may be some static
limitations on the number of devices per bus, etc -- I've never been
very familiar with that part of the code.  Please write back when you
figure it out so we know :)

Hi,

In the manual of DiskSim, there is limitation of device per bus: "A bus can have
no more than 15 disks or controllers attached to it.".

In this case, there are 20 disks per bus. One alternative is that partitioning
the disks into several groups, then connect them.

Subject: [Disksim-users] Question about vitual disk simulation.
Message-ID: <864507c401b735047beecbe8308dabab@i61797>


Hi all,
 
I'm going to simulate 'mydisk.c'.
I want to simulate for general disk simulation results that seek time, rotation time and access time.
According to DiskSim manual, I should input 6 arguments at the prompt line.
On the other hand, I should input these arguments
disksim(executable) 
at my DiskSim test simulation source of main().
But, I don't know what arguments are inputted at prompt line.
I have been tryed variable ways, but it was not executed with 'segmentation fault' error.
What should I input the 6 arguments? Please explain to me with some successful examples.
Thanks alot !
 
Best regards,
YG

Subject: [Disksim-users] Saturation in DISKSIM_malloc()
Message-ID: <1d34988d0710251400x53fde316mefbd517c6d4bb6ec@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using DiskSim-2.0 with the "Seagate Cheetah 9LP" disk listed on
the DiskSim website.
It works fine with some traces, but for some other more intensive
traces (intervals b/w
requests are short), it gives me a lot of "Stopping simulation because
of saturation" error
messages, and the simulation finally stops running.

I tried allocating more space for disksim by using a larger number for
the 2nd parameter
of the function disksim_interface_initialize(disk, len, paramFile,
outFile), but still the saturation
errors will kill the simulation. The difference is, if I use larger
len value, more saturation error
messages will be printed before the simulation is stopped.

Thanks for any help/suggestions.

Subject: [Disksim-users] DiskSim Argument
Message-ID: <7de1107abf2c3f26a9e67a2b990ae7f7@i61827>

Hi all, 
 
I have a question about argv[3].
I already read DiskSim manual but, I don't know that argv[3] is what kind of a file mean exactly.
Some file in the "disksim-3.0 directory" or some "external" file? 
Please any advice for me. I'll very appreciate your comment.
Thanks~!

Message-ID: <200709021701152968537@163.com>

Hi,all

In my experiment I found a very strange thing: No write hit in on-board disk cache!
I use the validate trace as following:

W Hit    5568004   8   1464.00000  53368.00000            ---request 1--
W Hit    5568012   8   1323.00000  54353.00000            ---request 2--
W Hit    1505868   4   1098.00000  32082.00000            ---request 3--
W Hit    1505868   4    879.00000  39461.00000            ---request 4--

# ./disksim cheetah9LP.parv file_1 validate trace 0

But no hit found in the file_1. Theoretically there should be a write combine with request 1 and 2. Also a write hit with 4 after 3. But indeed there is no.

I tracked the  disk_buffer_select_write_segment and  disk_release_hda function. There is no conserve of write although I use the fast write mode. A new request own a segment for write and release it after completion.

And I increased the segment counts in the cheetah9LP.diskspecs. There is litter increase(less than 1%) about the cache hit ratio! (with command ./disksim cheetah9LP.parv file_1 validate cheetah9LP.trace 0)

Does this really the cache management for modern disk? 

I think the fast write mode enabled can conserve more small write and then write them optimizely (sometime sequentially write or with freeblock scheduling policy).

Thank you for your discussion.

Subject: [Disksim-users] Interfacing disksim synchronously
Message-ID: <891be9410709062343w7ee98d2dhd037e33f6ef9298e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi *,

I'm looking to integrate disksim in a full system simulator. I've read
through disksim_interface*, the manual etc and everywhere one of the
requirements listed is that the simulator support asynchronous
operation -- that is, it should be able to proceed without blocking
for the disk request to finish, and at some later time disksim would
deliver the completion notification.

Due to some constraints, I need to interface disksim in a synchronous
fashion. That is, I'd like to pass in the request to disksim, and I'd
like disksim to immediately return to me the time it _would_ take to
finish the request. I can then inject the appropriately delay in the
external simulator myself.

Can anyone suggest what would be a good way to go about this? Is this
even doable?

Thanks,

Subject: [Disksim-users] run on 64bit systems ...
Message-ID: <1189172300.21053.226.camel@localhost>

So,

	When we apply this, disksim starts to run on 64bit systems. Is there
-really- no-one collecting patches / build-fixes for disksim, wrt.
rolling a new release ?

	I would have thought the combination of "build with recent gcc's" and
"run on 64bit systems" would be worth others having ? :-) Fix from Radek
Doulik FWIW.

	Regards,

		Michael.

You should be able to use the disksim interface as-is, although it
will preclude you from doing a few things.  Basically your approach
should be to issue a request using disksim_interface_request_arrive()
and then call disksim_interface_internal_event() repeatedly until
disksim calls your completion function.  The time given to the
completion function should be the time that the request finished.

One limitation is that you can only ever have one request
"outstanding" to disksim at a time, meaning that you won't see any
effect from scheduling, overlapping of seek and transfer, etc.  This
may not matter to you.

Also, your simulator's notion of time will be different from disksim's
view of time, since your repeated calls to
disksim_interface_internal_event() will cause disksim's internal time
to advance into the future, relative to your simulator's time.

Good luck.

Dear Professor Ganger,

I am a Ph.d student in China.
Now I encountered a problem in my research job that I want to keep the data for the request in the disksim. And reuse them later.  But disksim can't do this. As one paper in FAST'02 title "Timing-Accurate Storage Emulation" argued to do such a job. Is it possible for me to get the source code used in the paper?

Thank you very much!

You will be much better off building a simple "store actual data in a big
file" component of your own.

Good luck,

When I run ./runvalid an error ocurs referred to no such device, and  
It seems to be the IOMAPPING.

How can I use IOMAP for one disk?What is the tracedev for that disk??

Hi Lanyue,

now I?m using my own traces with this format:

1 0 512 1
2 0 1024 512 1

and so on...


I want to read 100Mb, is it necessary to do a trace file with that ??  
It will be so big and so hard to write in a file.

What can I do to do a test of reading 100Mb??

thanks

I do not install bison package on my OS, is it a must? On the introdution page, it said "it requires no special system software". 

Is there any recommanded OS(and version) or package list?

Thank you!

Subject: [Disksim-users] DiskSim under a Python simulator?
Message-ID: <CE1123BD-F871-419C-899A-31AF49142970@soe.ucsc.edu>

I would like to run multiple concurrent instances of DiskSim as slaves  
to a simulator written in Python. I'm thinking about writing a Python  
extension module for disksim_interface.h/c, but I'm hoping there's an  
easier way.

Has anyone already created a Python extension module for DiskSim that  
I might use? I looked around, but didn't find one. Alternately, does  
someone know of a straightforward way to drive DiskSim from Python  
without an extension module?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <200812052255205150970@gmail.com>

hi,all
      I used a kind of trace which's request number is 567894(all of they are read operation). I used disksim4.0 to simulate this trace run in a storage system. The report of the disksim say that "overall I/O system total requests handled: 375522". It is very surprising! The trace request number is 567894. Why request number unequal to total requests handled ? Is it because the request is too intensive, disksim discard some requests? or maybe is other reasons?
     Thank you!

I find the requests with devno 2 have no difference between requests with devno 0,1,3,4,5. 
Who have encountered this problem? What the reason is it?

When I simulated a storage system, can I use DiskSim to evaluate the energy consumption? If so, how to do? What are the energy-related metrics in DiskSim?
Thanks a lot.

Message-ID: <200812161641500464995@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn>

Hi,
the SSD model comes with no support of cache simulation, but I want to simulate a SSD based storage system with cache support in the controller or in the iodriver. I tried to run SSD with a type=3 controller including a cachemem model, but the following error comes up:

Stopping simulation because of saturation: simtime 136334.931000, totalreqs 10000
last request:  dev=0, blk=44403360, cnt=8, 1 (R==1)

The parameter file, output file and trace file are in the attachmemt. 
I want to know whether there is a solution to it or whether there is another way to simulate a SSD with cache support??

Thx! Looking foward for the reply!

I think you should reduce the I/O intensiveness of the workload and try
again.

Subject: [Disksim-users] I/O driver q-time differences between splitted
	requests in RAID0
Message-ID: <47A39D2A.5000701@miners.utep.edu>

Hi,

In DiskSim, under RAID 0, each request is divided in to 2 when it 
reaches the I/O driver. I believe that they should have to same I/O 
driver queue time. However, I found that they are actually different in 
my experiment. Can anyone explain the reason?

I am collecting per-request I/O driver queue time with the following 
simplified configuration.

I/O driver
- FCFS
- only the base subqueue is used
- allow queueing in subsystem

CTLR
- FCFS
- queue length = 8
- cache disabled

topology
- RAID 0
- 2 disks

DISK
- IBM18es
- queue length = 16
- FCFS
- prefetching disabled
- cache disabled

The simple trace w./ 50 requests that I used (in ascii format).
1 0 4 4 1
2 0 8 4 1
3 0 12 4 1

50 0 200 4 1


This is how I captured the per-request I/O driver queue time
In ioqueue_get_next_request_from_subqueue(), I added a parameter to 
identify is this function is serving an I/O driver, controller or a 
simple disk. If it is serving an I/O driver, I record the queue time 
which is passed as a parameter to stat_update() on line 2632 of 
disksim_ioqueue.c

Here is how it looks like.
    while (ret) {
       stat_update(&queue->qtimestats, (temp->starttime - ret->time));

         if(dev_type == IODRIVER) {
                 printf("ioqueue_get_next_request_from_subqueue, iodrv 
qtime= %lf\n", (te
mp->starttime - ret->time));
         }

       ret = ret->next;
    }

Here are parts of the result.
ioqueue_get_next_request_from_subqueue, iodrv qtime= 0.000000
ioqueue_get_next_request_from_subqueue, iodrv qtime= 0.000000
ioqueue_get_next_request_from_subqueue, iodrv qtime= 0.000000
ioqueue_get_next_request_from_subqueue, iodrv qtime= 0.000000

ioqueue_get_next_request_from_subqueue, iodrv qtime= 0.000000
ioqueue_get_next_request_from_subqueue, iodrv qtime= 0.000000

ioqueue_get_next_request_from_subqueue, iodrv qtime= 26.344682
ioqueue_get_next_request_from_subqueue, iodrv qtime= 25.445682
ioqueue_get_next_request_from_subqueue, iodrv qtime= 41.054183
ioqueue_get_next_request_from_subqueue, iodrv qtime= 42.155183
Overall I/O System Total Requests handled:      3
System logorg #0 disk Total Requests handled:   6
IOdriver Total Requests handled:        6
IOdriver #0 device #0 Total Requests handled:   3
IOdriver #0 device #1 Total Requests handled:   3

Disk #0 Total Requests handled: 3
Disk #1 Total Requests handled: 3
Controller #0 devices Total Requests handled:   6
Controller #0 device #0 Total Requests handled: 3
Controller #0 device #1 Total Requests handled: 3

Since 3 requests are handled by the overall I/O system and FCFS is used, 
the queue time of these 3 requests appear to be

request 1 (9.635181 & 10.736181)
request 2 (26.344682 & 25.445682)
request 3 (41.054183 & 42.155183)

Why is there an ~1ms difference between the divided requests of each 
request?

Thank you very much!

Yipkei

Subject: [Disksim-users] Disk Transfer Time questions
Message-ID: <47A8E209.3060005@miners.utep.edu>

Hi,

Question:
1) Transfer time is longer than expected. Why?

Configuration
- I/O driver (FCFS)
- CTLR (FCFS)
- Disk (IBM 18es, prefetching/cache disabled, FCFS)

Read transfer time:
BUS (between CTLR and disk): .0512ms

Bulk sector transfer time:
CTLR: 0.0ms
disk: .101ms

Request size: 4 blocks

With 1 disk, the "Disk Transfer time average" is 25.05ms.

Question 1) Transfer time is longer than expected. Why?
Below is quote from the user manual.
"This specifies the time for the disk to transfer a single 512-byte 
block over the bus. Recall that this value is compared with the 
corresponding bus and controller block transfer values to determine the 
actual transfer time (i.e., the maximum of the three values)."

Disk has the max transfer time (.101ms) per block. but, .101ms * 4 = 
.404 ms << 25.05ms, where 4 is the request size. Does the transfer time 
include any other factor which makes the result that big?

Thank you very much.

Regards,
Yipkei

Subject: [Disksim-users] Which queue for scheduling scheme ?
Message-ID: <bc867e590801211641iffd9805gcb527f2ce07f427a@mail.gmail.com>

In disksim, there are multiple queues, for example, the queue for device
drives, the queue for controls and the queue for disks.

I think the queue related to multiple disk scheduling schems (e.g. SSTP,
SCAN and so on) are the queue for device drives not the queue for disks.
This is also imposed in the reference manual of disksim 3.0 implicitly.

However, let us have a look at RAID1, there are multiple disks in one RAID.
so there are multiple disk heads, and then there are multiple positioning
times for a specific request for  a data, because of the mirror of data.
I think there must be a selection algorithm in the driver of RAID to
deciding which replica will be read.

Would anyone tell me whether the conclusion i guess is right or not ?

The scheduling schemes are really implemented in device drivers not in disks
?

There are multiple queues, including one at each disk and one for each
driver-level device at the simulated device driver level.  Each has a
scheduling algorithm.

Good luck,

One IO request will generate many internal DiskSim events.  For
example, there are separate events as the request moves up and down
the controller/bus stacks, for seeks, rotational latency, and data
transfer, the caches, and probably a bunch more.  These are all
internal and have no effect on the external results (other than the
fact that they make the simulation work).  One of the reasons that IOs
are broken into many fine-grained events is so that new IO requests
can be interleaved into the simulation at any time while other
requests are outstanding.

DiskSim 2.0 to run that disk and can not run in DiskSim 4.0 environment? Is
it easy or possible to make some changes for Fujitsu disk files so that it
can be run in DiskSim 4.0?

Thanks,
--Mingju

I have executed "runvalid" correctly!But I still don't know how to use disksim as a stand-alone simulator or incorporate disksim into a larger-scale simulator.I can't get any useful information from the user manual about the detail of how to use disksim.Can you teach me the details of the use of disksim(e.g. which file should be executed) or tell me the files that I can get the information from?Thank you!

Can I add a new algorithm about RAID to disksim or simulate a module combined with many small modules(e.g.RAID5 module consist of many RAID5 modules).If so how to realize them?

Yes, it is open source software.  Good luck.

 hi,
    I'm from china.The disks that the disksim can simulate are too old.If I want to add a new disk model such as IBM Ultrastar 36Z15,what should I do now? I cann't find the parameter of zone about this disk  on line.I hope to have a good man can give me this informationthank you .

The latest release (4.0) includes the DIXtrac tool, with which you can
extract your own parameters.

Good luck!

Hi,


I checked the examples in the valid / directory , I suppose if I want  
to make a read of 100Mb with 512 bytes for each request the  
configuration for Generator is:

Number of I/O requests to generate : 200  # 102400 bytes / 512 bytes =  
200 requests

But I don?t know how to put this 512 bytes in the generator...could It  
be the parameter Sizes?? but how to make it for sizes of 512,1024,  
2048 and so on??

Hi,

Like Lei, when I runvalid DiskSim 4.0, I am getting mismatching results. I have 
tried this on a OS 10.4 with gcc version 4.0.1. Also tried it on a linux box and 
got the same mismatching outputs.

Any ideas on what the problem might be?

Thanks,

Hi,

I compiled the source code of disksim 4.0 successfully on my virtual machine 
(Fedora Core 4), and ran runvalid and memsvalid files under the valid directory.

The results are as follows, and it seems that,  
1) for runvalid, some simulation results are not the same as expected, please 
see the results marked in red.
2) for memsvalid, it looks like there is no mems.g3.parv file under the valid 
directory.

Thanks,

Lei

Hi Ted,

You mean identical results in the sense that they are matching expected results? Or idential results to what Lei and I observe (mismatching to expected results)?

Hi Ted,

You mean identical results in the sense that they are matching expected results? Or idential results to what Lei and I observe (mismatching to expected results)?

Thanks,

Hi,

When I run *memsvalid*, I can't find *mems.g3.parv* in disksim-4.0/valid,
Could anyone tell me where *mems.g3.parv* is ?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <207944.23378.qm@web15204.mail.cnb.yahoo.com>

hi,
when the valaue of Probability of time-critical request is set to 1.0,  disksim report that the number of handled request is same to the configured value of the parametre, Number of I/O requests to generate, in parv file. however, when changed it's value to 0.0, disksim always report that the number of handled request is to be short 1 less than  issued  request. why? 

following are disksim reported:

Subject: [Disksim-users] why is the number of
 handled request to be
Message-ID: <20080617132317.DGA91659@po1.mail.umd.edu>

I have not tested with synthetically generated traces much, but from what i have tested with real traces, DiskSim stops simulating when it reads the last request from the file BEFORE it processes the request. This is probably due to internal timing, that, if the last request is issued at time X, then simulation should have continued for X + last_request_service_time, which is an unknown. Therefore DiskSim will stop at time X, which is a known value, after it received the last request before it handled the request. This is my guess.

Thanks,

Cagdas

Hello,

the updated version of the DiskSim 4.0 tar balls, posted yesterday on  
the website,  now includes the missing mems.g3.parv file.

Hello,

we have fixed the runvalid mismatches and updated the DiskSim 4.0 tar  
balls on the web site.

By mistake, I included the runvalid values for previous disksim  
releases rather than values calibrated for DiskSim 4.0. The  
discrepancy for some of the runs is caused by the order in which  
modules such as diskmodel are loaded when disksim is started and the  
resulting change to the random generator seed.

It took me some time to find out how to do so, and here it is.

To compile Disksim 3.0 on Ubuntu, you need to install following
packages:
sudo apt-get install flex-old
sudo apt-get install gcc-2.95

then in the source directory, type:
make CC=gcc-2.95

I compiled Disksim 3.0 use gcc4.2 on  fedora 8 and successful.
Is there any problem useing gcc4.x ?

Well, congratulations!

But on Ubuntu, I got lots of errors using gcc4.2. I don't know why
differ from Fedora.

After modifying some source code, I can get it compiled after gcc4.2,
but I think use gcc2.95 is better.

Well, congratulations!

But on Ubuntu, I got lots of errors using gcc4.2. I don't know why
differ from Fedora.

After modifying some source code, I can get it compiled after gcc4.2,
but I think use gcc2.95 is better.

Message-ID: <614944.256871206492812688.JavaMail.coremail@bj126app85.126.com>

 I'm using disksim-3.0.
 
Run disksim as follows,it's OK!
/disksim ascii.parv ascii.outv ascii ascii.trace 0
 
//ascii.parv & ascii.trace are the files provided by the disksim itself( in  ../valid/)
 
Then I edit ascii.parv, change the scheduling policy into 8 (3 original)which represents SPTF_OPT.
Run it again,the result shows as follows:
/disksim ascii.parv ascii.outv ascii ascii.trace 0
RETURNING NULL!!
RETURNING NULL!!
RETURNING NULL!!
RETURNING NULL!!
RETURNING NULL!!
RETURNING NULL!!
RETURNING NULL!!
.....
 
Why? SPTF_OPT is widely used in real system ,disksim must have implemented it,but how does this happen...Looking forwards to your answers!!Thank you!!
 Best wishes!!

Subject: [Disksim-users] disk head position to logical block number and vice
	versa
Message-ID: <854da8df0803251949r3bc2b1cdw54c8ac69910b48fe@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I was trying to find out how to get logical block number from given disk
head position by structure, currdisk->mech_state

i was using
currdisk->model->layout->dm_convert_atop(currdisk->model,&mech_state,&pbn);
to get the physical block number and then,
rval=currdisk->model->layout->dm_translate_ptol(currdisk->model, &pbn, 0);
to
get corresponding logical block number. Not sure, if this is the right thing
to do ?

Furthermore, i was looking at the disksim code, for disksim_diskctlr.c ,
line no. 3987 ( version 3),

 currdisk->model->mech->dm_latency(currdisk->model,
                          &startstate,
                          curr->cause,
                          curr->bcount,
                          immed,
                          0);

curr is current request event, and i think its cause field denotes the
starting sector from/to which data needs to read/written.
the conversion of this sector to angle uses dm_pbn_skew , but if i convert
this angle to get pbn, its sector comes to be different.
Any suggestion, why this may happen?

thanks and regards,
ashok

Hi, all
In my simulation platform, disksim is set as a slave component. When system level program read I/O requests from I/O tracefile, the time interval between any two requests are the actual time. However, the time dimension in disksim is not equal to the actual time. What i should do to coordinate these two time dimensions when i issue external requests into disksim ?

I believe that the manual talks about how to do this, and that there is
also example code in the distribution.  In a nutshell, you need to have
disksim time advance with simulation time (and the master simulator should
be reading the tracefile and feeding requests to disksim, if disksim is
part of a larger simulator).

Good luck!

Hi,

I figured the conversion from angle to physical ( The manual does talk about
it at end :) ).. Now I am trying to find out in the disksim code, where
calculation for rotational latency take place, and where actually statistics
gets updated for the corresponding rotation.. Any quick pointer to this,
would be quite useful!

Thanks,
ashok

Subject: [Disksim-users] asynchronous callback
Message-ID: <200803270839542186095@gmail.com>

In syssim_driver.c, there are N requests issued into disksim. However, they are synchronous, the second request is issued when main() the first request completed. In my implementation,  i want to issue requests from iotracefile according to their actual time interval. 
 
In other words, the example in syssim_driver.c is synchronous and i want to implement asynchronous. 
 
( I want to issue the second request got from iotracefile before the completion of the first request )

How can i accomplish this purpose?




Best regards!

There are no error in compiling process. however, when i run disksim the message, segmentation fault, is printed. why and how can i do for it.

Message-ID: <99113.96269.qm@web15201.mail.cnb.yahoo.com>

hi, everyone
I translate the spc oltp trace to the ascii format: Request arrival time, Device number,Block number,Request size and Request flags. however, when i run disksim use atlas10k disk driver, it prints the following message: Stopping simulation because of saturation....
I trace the running process, I find that only 17 requests of total 10017 requests from the trace are handled. The same result is present after i changed disk queue length(10, 20,100,1000) an I/O Trace Time Scale(range from 1 to 10).  Otherwise, the 17th request was issued at time 0.6 and it's complete time is 94.6. the response time is clearly too large.
can anyone give me some advice for it, or the all of disksim's parv files for  running spc oltp traces.


thanks a lot!

Hi,

I compiled the source code of disksim 4.0 successfully on my virtual machine (Fedora Core 4), and ran runvalid and memsvalid files under the valid directory.

The results are as follows, and it seems that,  
1) for runvalid, some simulation results are not the same as expected, please see the results marked in red.
2) for memsvalid, it looks like there is no mems.g3.parv file under the valid directory.

Thanks,

Lei

Very cool! Thanks a lot.

How about some updates to drive infos? I can probably try to run DIXtrac

That's great. It will push forward the storage research strongly.

 

Thanks a lot.

Hi,

 

I compiled the source code of disksim 4.0 successfully on my virtual machine (Fedora Core 4), and ran runvalid and memsvalid files under the valid directory.

 

The results are as follows, and it seems that,  

1) for runvalid, some simulation results are not the same as expected, please see the results marked in red.

2) for memsvalid, it looks like there is no mems.g3.parv file under the valid directory.

 

Thanks,

 

Lei

I can reproduce this now that my home machine is 64bit -- this looks like a
real bug and when I got past it, I ran into a lot of other 64 bit problems.
I'll see what I can do about it but for the time being, I would say the
current codebase has a number of 64 bit issues.

If I try the mod.pl command by itself, there is no output and no new file
created.

Any informed people to help?

mode (LF).  Perl didn't appear to like that.

Also valid/runvalid

Hi, 

         How to write a .parv file which mixed the MEMS-based disk and
normal disk?

For example.  disk 0~1 are MEMS-based disk and disk 2~7 are atlask10K disk?

Message-ID: <200811062156171569963@gmail.com>

Hello all
   
I use disksim to simulate the  storage subsystem. The trace is websearch1.spc which had been changed to ascii format. The number of io request is 100000+.
But when i run disksim(./disksim disk.parv output ascii WebSearch1.ascii 0), it stop abnormally. The error out is:
    "Stopping simulation because of saturation: simtime 73.129074,totalreqs 10008"
I don't know why. Most of requests hadn't executed.
Who can tell me the reason ?
thank you for your help! 
Have a nice day!

Hi lucky.wu.han,

The reason is that the trace used in your testing is too intensive.

You should modify the parameter "I/O Trace Time Scale" to 2, 3 or much
larger number.

Please see the section 3.3 of disksim v4.0 reference manual.   ( iosim_block
).

Regards!

Hi Wu,

That is very likely due to your requests piling up on the queue subcomponent (which has a hard limit of 10K requests in queue). How fast your requests are arriving (what is the request interarrival rate in your trace)? And how long do you think it will take your disk to service a request?

I know that many would be interested in this, and some may not have
seen it.

From: Ted Wobber <wobber@microsoft.com>
Subject: SSD Add-on for DiskSim

Hello -

You all have at one time or another requested access to the source code for the DiskSim extension that we described in our USENIX ¨08 paper ＾Design Tradeoffs for SSD Performance￣.

This extension is now available under a limited non-commercial (click-through) license from the MSR download site:

http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/default.aspx

This download takes the form of a new ＾ssdmodel￣ source subdirectory for the DiskSim source tree, along with a patch file that should modify the existing DiskSim source files to insert hooks for the new code.  A top-level directory is also created for a VisualStudio build of DiskSim if you want it, but the patched environment should compile under Linux and CygWin as well.  We haven¨t tested it for Macs.

We assume that you are starting with the DiskSim 4.0 release of mid-June (6/23/2008).  We have only tested the main release, not the one with DIXTrac.

Remember that this code simulates an idealized SSD (e.g., one that doesn¨t exist in practice) that is parameterized solely by the performance of NAND flash parts.  We have been unsuccessful so far in guessing the algorithms used in commercial SSDs well enough to validate our simulation.

This code has so far not been tested outside of our lab, so there may be bugs ・ especially in the installation steps.  We seek your help in finding such bugs before making a wider announcement (e.g. on the DiskSim distribution list).

Please let us know how you fare.

Best regards,

Ted Wobber and Vijayan Prabhakaran

Subject: [Disksim-users] Problem when running disksim in emulation mode
Message-ID: <25ffcb8d0811090853s581b5875kf8081cba1d3088cb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I configured disksim to work in emulation mode using the functions in
disksim_interface.c.  I have setup disksim in the target side of ISCSI
driver. So, as the requests come to the ISCSI target, I send it to disksim
through disksim_interface_request_arrive() and then get the simulation time
from the disksim.

When I run it, it works fine for quite a long time, but when I stress it
with continous worklaods(i copied a linux source tree to the emulated disk),
the assert stmt in src/disksim_diskctlr.c  viz. "ddbg_assert2(tmpioreq != 0,
"Cannot find ioreq")" in line number 3327 fails and the simulation stops.  I
have no clue as to how the
tmpioreq is becoming 0 suddenly.

It would be great if anyone could tell me the reason/fix for this problem.

Thanks,
Sankaran.

Hi Sankaran,

The real data can't be written onto the emulation disks in disksim. I am not
sure whether this is the actual reason.

If you copy a linux source code to the emulated disk, I think you should
transform then into the trace format which can be accepted by disksim, such
as ascii format.

Hi Yinliang,

Thanks for your reply. Just to be clear, I am not storing the data onto the
emulated disk.  I store the data in a ramdisk and use the disksim for
inducing the delay alone.

Thanks,
Sankaran.

   I want to know how disksim change LBA to PBA(cylinder,header,sector)?
Which function do this thing?

   For example, a request is "0.011286  0  34567136  64  1". The LBA is
34567136, which function in disksim change this LBA to 3D
PBA(cylinder,header,sector)?

   I am a freshman in useing disksim. Your help is very important for me.

   Looking forward to your help!

Hi Gunusha,

I do not recall where LBA is converted to PBA but you can follow from diskmech.c.

If you search for where diskacctime is called, you can track its inputs cylno, surfaceno, blkno, which all together form the PBA. Very likely that LBA is converted into PBA right before diskacctime is called.

double diskacctime (disk *currdisk, band *currband, int type, int rw, double reqtime, int cylno, int surfaceno, int blkno, int bcount, int immedaccess)

Hope this helps until someone else provides more accurate information.

Thanks,

Cagdas

Subject: [Disksim-users] "No rule to make target `memsmodel_mems_param.h'"
	when compiling DiskSim 4.0
Message-ID: <32627823-B628-41DC-95B5-3EBC9AA93625@soe.ucsc.edu>

I'm attempting to compile DiskSim 4.0 with DIXTrac, and I'm getting an  
error about a missing rule:

make[2]: *** No rule to make target `memsmodel_mems_param.h', needed  
by `modules.h'.  Stop.

What can I do to get this working?

Here's my configuration, briefly:

CPU: 4 x 2.6 GHz dual-core AMD Opteron
OS: Centos 5
make: GNU Make 3.81
gcc: gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20070626 (Red Hat 4.1.2-14)

The complete make output follows.

Thank you!

     ~ Esteban

Subject: [Disksim-users] Question about addtoextraq and using the contents
	in extraq in the future
Message-ID: <70cf1c8b0811300516q71252d67h99b012a861e5ecfc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I'm currently working on DiskSim, and I found some situations, which
seems to be a bug or my misuse of disksim functions:

When we call ioqueue_physical_access_done, ioqueue_remove_completed_request
and then ioqueue_remove_from_subqueue will be called to remove the iobuf
that was holding the ioreq_event that we are trying to remove from the
ioqueue. Then the "tmp" iobuf which was removed from
ioqueue_remove_from_subqueue will be added to extraq at the end
of ioqueue_remove_completed_request. At the same time queue->current which
is also pointing to the same position as "tmp" will point to extraq since
"tmp" has been added to extraq.
Now we want to remove another ioreq_event. We will follow the same procedure
as above. When we are selecting the "tmp" iobuf, containing
the ioreq_event, at the begining of ioqueue_remove_completed_request,
"queue->current" is pointing to extraq (actually the situation might have
been same in the procedure above). The following "if ((tmp->state !=
PENDING) || (ioqueue_request_match(done, tmp) == 0))" should let us find the
right tmp from the "queue->list" instead of selecting "queue->current" as
tmp. However, if the blkno and the opid of "queue->current," which once was
an iobuf and is currently in extraq, are the same as the opid and the
blkno of the ioreq_event we are removing, the "tmp" will be set as
"queue->current." Then ioqueue_remove_from_subqueue will try to remove
the "tmp (or a event in extraq)" and will cause an error because tmp->prev
is NULL.


When we add an event including ioreq_event or iobuf to extraq, doesn't it
means we do not care about the contents of the event any more?
 Why don't we wipe out the unneccesary data as soon as a event is added to
extraq or before reuse?

Maybe this situation was caused, because I created ioreq_events in my code
in the device level, which may have violated the opid generating rules.
To avoid this problem, I have added the code

"memset(temp->space, 0, DISKSIM_EVENT_SPACESIZE * sizeof(char));"

in the addtoextraq, but cause other ioqueue error. I also tried

"(iobuf *) temp)->opid = -1" or (= 0)
 "(iobuf *) temp)->blkno = -1" or (= 0)

which also cause other error in ioqueue.


My question is:

1. When event is added to extraq is it completely safe to wipe out all the
contents except for the variables connecting each other in the extraq?
If not what kind of information should be preserved?

2. Can you please explain some rules that I should observe when using
getfromextraq, addtoextraq and ioreq_copy?


Thank you :)

I've figured it out now: I had make set to use -j4 by default, and  
using multiple jobs when compiling DiskSim causes all sorts of havoc.

(I still can't compile, but for other reasons; if I don't figure it  
out I'll post with a new subject line.)

I cannot go thru the files in detail, but when DiskSim stops with that
form of message, it usually means that the requests are consistently
arriving faster than the underlying storage system can handle them.
With trace-driven simulation, there is no feedback between request
service times and subsequent request arrivels, so the queue of requests
to be serviced grows and grows (as queueing theory dictates that it
must)... at a hard-coded constant queue length, the simulator exits
with this message rather than continuing to simulate an absurd situation.

(It can also mean that there is a bug in the configuration that causes
no requests to be serviced.  But, this appears to be an instance of the
case above.)

Good luck,

Greg

Hi,everyone. I am a new user of DiskSim, but I don't know how to use the
DiskSim. Is DiskSim only a data generator?

Dear Steve,

Thank you.
But I don't know where can we get the workload? Would you please explain =
me
how?

Thanks.

Hello,Yanhui-iis,

	Disksim is a disk simulator. To evaluate a disk system, it can
generate IO workload.

All the best.

Hi Yanhui-iis,



I think you should read the reference manual of DiskSim in detail and then
you will find all the answers.



Please download the reference manual
http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/DiskSim/index.html#code



If you have got the distribution of DiskSim, open \valid, then you will find
what you want to have.



Please notice the following files:  ***.*trace*



If you want to know how to use DiskSim and what DiskSim can do, please read
the reference manual. You can get useful information from this document.





*Best regards!*

Hi,

I am a computer science graduate student of San Diego State University. I am
seeking for an environment to perform flash drives simulation.
 I just want to confirm if there is a possibility to use DiskSim simulation
environment for the purpose.

Thanks,
Abhinav

hello again!

I changed the queue length from 1 to 100 and from 1 to 5 and so on,  
random changes.

Disk response time average is always the same value as I posted first.

do I need to change something else??

Message-ID: <28c1b0010904031045n27949913g29647bb747e0d753@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all -

   I am considering extending DiskSim to explore some ideas related
to improving storage system energy-efficiency using flash.  One
consideration is DiskSim's simulation performance, since I hope to
evaluate the ideas on traces with over 1B IOs.

   When I compile and run DiskSim on a 1M-entry trace file
(ascii.trace replicated 10X with the timestamps updated using the same
configuration as the runvalid test for ascii.trace), it takes 91
seconds to execute on 3.2GHz Xeon (quad-core, but I don't think that
matters since DiskSim is single-threaded, right?).  That translates
into a bit over 10K simulated IOPs, which is slower than real-time for
some of the high-end configurations I'd like to explore.  And it
translates into a little over 24 hours to simulation 1B IOs, which
could get painful.

   One of my colleagues asked Greg (Ganger) about DiskSim's
performance at FAST, and Greg apparently replied that 10K simulated
IOPs was slower than he would have predicted.  He further suggested
that I contact this list to see if it fits other people's experience.
What kind of simulation speeds are y'all seeing?  Obviously it depends
on the configuration being evaluated, but the ascii.parv configuration
did not look at all onerous.  Are there ways to improve simulation
performance that a new DiskSim user like myself might not have found?
For the DiskSim implementors out there, how tightly tuned is DiskSim's
performance -- has it already been tuned pretty hard (so there isn't
likely much more performance to squeeze out) or has performance tuning
not been a focus (so perhaps simulation speed could be improved a lot
if somebody were to focus on it)?

   Thanks for your input!

Cheers,
John

I can answer a few of the last questions: DiskSim performance tuning
happened some in its very early days (early 90s), with some regretable
long-term code ickiness, and not at all since.  I imagine performance
can be improved by minimizing configurations, such as by minimizing
layers of busses/controllers.  I'm sure that it is far from efficient,
though I was surprised by the 10Kops/second number... doesn't mean that
it's not accurate, but was quite surprising to me.

Hello everybody! I need to use Disksim 3.0 for my Bachelor's Degree project and there is no way I can install it. I am using Ubuntu 8.1 and the Makefile always fails, it says there are errors in the sources (I took the sources from http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/DiskSim, version 3.0). Is there anything I am missing? Can anyone help with an already compiled version, with?a .deb or .run file? Thank you in advance, all the best!

Message-ID: <c9c83c680908021506r287528dfsa596377036c8dea9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I want to run a number of traces of different characteristics, in a raid
system I simulated in disksim.   The problem is, when I use many traces
which was collected from a system with more disks than my current simulated
setup, the disksim is not able to handle the request rate of the trace.  The
simulation stops with a message "Stopping simulation because of saturation"
which means the requests are fed in  at a rate faster than the storage
system can handle it.   Is there a parameter in disksim that asks it to stop
feeding in more requests when the current requests are not yet complete ?  I
guess we call it a open-loop simulation (??)...

Basically my goal is to use the simulator to any traces irrespective of the
request rate and the configuration of the system -- when I feed a more
intense trace with say 1500 reqs/sec, and the storage system can handle only
500 reqs/sec, the simulator should still run correctly by controlling the
rate of feeding in the trace requests to the storage layer..

Any help would be greatly appreciated..

Thanks a lot!

Krithika.

> The simulation stops with a message "Stopping simulation because of

I ran into this error myself.  It is a hard limit.  In disksim_lororg.c, you
can find the offending code as:

   if (currlogorg->stat.outstanding >= MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH) {
      fprintf(stderr,"Stopping simulation because of saturation: simtime %f,
totalreqs %d\n", simtime, disksim->totalreqs);
      fflush(stderr);
      fprintf (outputfile, "Stopping simulation because of saturation:
simtime %f, totalreqs %d\n", simtime, disksim->totalreqs);
      fprintf (outputfile, "last request:  dev=%d, blk=%d, cnt=%d, %d
(R==1)\n",curr->devno, curr->blkno, curr->bcount, (curr->flags & READ));
      disksim_simstop();
   }

MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH is 10000 and is not based on any underlying cache
configuration or anything.  For example, I have configured a memory cache of
8192 blocks, but outstanding requests can still exceed 10000, perhaps due to
multiple requests for the same blocks, etc.  I would be inclined to comment
out this code, if, as in my case, you actually find it to be invalid for
your given configuration.

I think it would work.  Section 3.4.10 of disksim4-manual.pdf describes
using one device as a cache for another.  A sample file to start with is
disksim-4.0/valid/synthcachedev.parv.  I would:

1) modify that file to add an SSD device (perhaps copying the "ssdmodel_ssd
SSD {...}" section from a .parv file in the ssdmodel/valid subdirectory), 
2) add it to the topology under BUS1, and 
3) change the "cache device" line to refer to the SSD device, and give it a
test.

Not sure if commenting out is a good idea. I tried to increase the MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH value. But it appears that disksim either hangs or takes a really really long time to finish if I do this. You can see the offending while loop by attaching a debugger to it. Basically, the loop seems to be making progress, but it's hard to say for sure since it seems to run forever.

	Which may be fixed by my patch:

	As yet un-replied to AFAICS ;-)

	OTOH - though it now compiles cleanly, and all the fixes were obvious
in one way or another; I've as yet to hook DiskSim up and test it live;
so YMMV.

	If I get no response wrt. the patch inclusion process, I guess I'll
just check it into a git/ repository somewhere and post a link to that.

	HTH,

git clone git://gitorious.org/iogrind/mainline.git

    That includes a patched version of disksim with several fixes and a
simpler API that we use in iogrind.

    Of course, really - we need a separate github repo setting up for
that beast, and it needs a -lot- of cleanup: the riddling with global
variables, and the general state of the code is quite extraordinary ;-)

Hi,

Quoting "Yiying Zhang" <yyzhang at cs.wisc.edu>:
> When I try to compile disksim on a 64bit machine

Yes, disksim currently doesn't compile on 64bit machines. I did some  
corrections and get it to compile, but I didn't publish any patch up  
until now. Thank you for reminding me, I'll try to get that together.

export SSDMODEL_CFLAGS=-I$(SSDMODEL_INCL)

and how to execute them?

Hi, all
   How can I add a cache on top of the SSD add-on? I modify the controller type into controller type=3 and config some related parameters , however, it did not work, some problems occur: Stopping simulation because of saturation, it seems that the IO queue length is larger than the Max queue length and the reason is that the replacement algorithm does not work...
   Is there someone who has already simulated a cache on top of the SSD? could you help me? thanks a lot!

hi, all
fisrt , thx for ur sharing .
I have the same problem : IO queue saturation , but I didnt modify the
controller type (yet?) , is that necessary ?

All I do is  1. new  a  LRU-cache (replacement policy ) function
                  2. add it to the function  "ssd_media_access_request_element "

                  anything I forget to consider?

Subject: [Disksim-users] Question of SATA disk simulation
Message-ID: <4B3B3FC9.5070306@aces.snu.ac.kr>

Hi, all.

I want to extract disk parameter from an general HDD used at PC and
simulate it.

As I understood, parameter extraction is only available on SCSI disks.
But, when I searched the web, there are many cases people extracted
parameter from SATA disks and simulated them, and got result of SATA disks.

So the question is

1. Is it posibble to extract disk parameter from disk(which is not SCSI
disk)? the reason excluding SCSI is that it is not common for personal use.

2. If parameter extraction is not possible, is there a way to get disk
parameter of disks.

3. If parameter extraction is possible, is there no problem to just use
it? the reason of this question is disksim looks only for SCSI disks.

If you have any ideas, please let me know.

I really hope to get responses from anyone who have some ideas of these
questions.

Thanks,
JooHwan.

The "SCSI only" part is the disk parameter extraction tool (DIXtrac),
not the simulator (which is interface agnostic).  It only works for SCSI
because it uses SCSI commands in doing the extraction.  Other tools
(and parts of DIXtrac) can extract a subset of the disk parameters
used by disksim from other disks, by not using SCSI commands.

First, thank you for your quick reply.

I just have one more question.

If part of DIXtrac cna extract subset of the disk parameters, how could 
I do that? Or if you have some document of that matter, would you inform me.

And as there are other tools which can extract parameters from disks, do 
you have some in your mind to recommend me.

Again, thank you for your quick response.

Sorry, I don't have further guidance for you.  Parts of DIXtrac could be
modified to not rely on SCSI commands (and may already have been), and
I'm not aware of specific other tools.

Best luck,

Greg

A 'make clean' followed by a 'make' in the main disksim directory fixed this problem for me.

Subject: [Disksim-users] Traces
Message-ID: <2DA185B1-3232-414E-86C0-D2203E71C449@gmail.com>

Hi everyone!

I?m using ascii traces but I don?t know exactly if they are correct.
Here it is an example of them:



1 0 1 512 1
30 0 2 512 1
45 0 3 512 1
and so on

I want to do a read of 100mb. It is correct?

On the other hand I put this information on de *.parv file is it  
correct?

I think I could be misunderstood with the reading trace.

Thank you

Message-ID: <3330de3a0902221136t42e63801x787c0df39561c024@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Disksim crashes at ioqueue_remove_from_subqueue() when used along with ssd
add-on. This function removes tmp from the queue and resets the pointer in
the double linked list. But tmp->prev is NULL because of which disksim
crashes at tmp->prev->next. while accessing tmp->prev. Also, tmp->prev is
NULL for the entire tmp list.

Can someone provide the guidelines as to when we should be calling
ioqueue_insert_new_request() and when we should be calling
ioqueue_remove_from_subqueue() assuming that the requests are serviced in
FCFS. In this way, I can find out if I am incorrectly calling any of the two
functions mentioned above.

Thanks!

Hi Bhushan,

I don't know the specific runtime environment of your testing, so I can't
give you the accurate suggestion.

I think you'd better add a new request via addintq() function.

Also, you'd better check the complete of every subrequest in
iodriver_access_complete(),  and the complete of every logical request in
logorg_mapcomplete().

Furthermore, you'd better check the .parv file you used and adjust the queue
parameters.


I hope you find these suggestions useful.

Subject: [Disksim-users] "Sequential stream scheme" can't run correctly
Message-ID: <003301c99749$e7121ae0$b53650a0$@com>

Hi all,

 

I want to issue many write requests onto one single disk sequentially, so I
modify the "Sequential stream scheme" in .parv from 0 to 3   /*
IOQUEUE_CONCAT_BOTH */.

 

However, I encounter the following error information, 

 

*** assertion failed: in disk_buffer_sector_done() (disksim_diskctlr.c:
*****):  currdisk->fpcheck : 

Aborted.

 

 

 

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

 

Especially, I expect the answers from the developers of DiskSim.  I want to
know if the functionality of "Sequential stream scheme" has been implemented
in disksim correctly, and if not, what I should do to figure out this
problem. 

 

Thanks!

 

 

/* Sequential Stream Schemes */

#define IOQUEUE_CONCAT_READS                  1

#define IOQUEUE_CONCAT_WRITES                2

#define IOQUEUE_SEQSTREAM_READS     4

#define IOQUEUE_SEQSTREAM_WRITES        8

Yinliang,

I know that stuff worked 14 years ago... but, it would not be shocking if
noone had tried using it since I was a graduate student ;).

Good luck!

Thanks Ji-Yong and Yinliang.
I too had the same problem as Ji-Yang and adding unique opid to solved the
problem.

But I was wondering if this is the right fix or if it is some kind of
hack.My guess is the function ioqueue_request_match() should be changed to
find the correct match. I am trying to fix this function. Incase anyone has
done this exercise before or if adding unique opid is the correct solution
to this problem, please let me know.

Thanks again!

Message-ID: <3330de3a0901061115i529cfb29xd1bf4731a3f875b1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am using the SSD Add-on for Disksim analyzing the performance of different
traces. Is there a way to determine the response time for each
request(read/write) in the trace? While debugging through the code, I found
the "ioqueue_remove_completed_request" function call in disksim-ioqueue.c,
while updates the "outtimestats" variable with the response time but the
problem is this function gets called multiple times for each request.
I need this functionality to understand how the SSD responds for different
requests.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Bhushan -

Assuming that you are happy with a statistical summary of requests, the SSD add-on computes the request latency in aggregate and also gives information about the distribution of reads and writes.

It also gives similar numbers for each simulated flash chip.

If you need more detailed output, you can always hack the code.  The SSD request completion handler is in ssd.c:  ssd_request_complete.  There are also chip (element) access completion routines in that module.

Thanks Ted. I was looking at disksim_ioqueue.c
"ioqueue_remove_completed_request" instead of ssd.c. Your hint helped me
find what I needed. Thanks again.

However, no more information can be found. If anyone has, I was wondering if

I don't, although I think that there was a project at Princeton (under
Randy Wang) that built/explored such modeling.  I don't know if they
released their code.

Hi

I am having segmentation faults while using disksim for simulating

with the ssd add-on it gives segmentation fault for each of the
simulations in 'runvalid'.

please let me know If anyone has the solution.

Subject: [Disksim-users] Smart Controller needs Scheduler Section
Message-ID: <00e001c9fb4c$5bcbf7f0$1363e7d0$@net>

All,

 

I am attempting to implement the smart controller with a memory cache
(Controller type = 3).  In my initial parameter file, I neglected to add a
Scheduler section, which resulted in a Segmentation Fault.

 

It seems that a smart controller needs a scheduler section defined.  If this
is the case, it should probably be mentioned in section 3.4.7 of the Disksim
users manual.  To help myself avoid this error in the future, I inserted a
line at line 444 in disksim_ctlrsmart.c

 

ASSERT( currctlr->queue != NULL); // Current controller must have a queue
defined.

 

Although a more user friendly error message would probably be better
somewhere earlier in the code, at least an ASSERT is better than a
segmentation fault.

Subject: [Disksim-users] Need help understanding cache_mem_event struct
	usage in disksim_cachemem.c
Message-ID: <000501c9fe95$5958bde0$0c0a39a0$@net>

If anyone is familiar with disksim_cachemem.c, I have a question regarding
the usage of the cache_mem_event structure member lockstop.

 

In the function cachemem_getblock, it is used as:

 

rwdesc->lockstop = - (req->blkno % cache->atomsperbit);

 

Which would incline me to give it a definition of "Negative offset from the
requested logical block to the lock location for this block".  In another
function allocate_cache_space, it is used as:

 

allocdesc->lockstop = lbn - (lbn % linesize);

 

This would incline me to give it a definition of "Beginning of the
allocation unit for the specified logical block number."

 

In yet more places, it is assigned to lbn and vice versa.

 

These multiple uses for the same structure member are confusing me as to the
actual use in particular places.  Any help would be appreciated.

 

Sincerely,

 

David Maung

Subject: [Disksim-users] Add pesonalized algorithm to DiskSim
Message-ID: <214190.60205.qm@web30103.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi, 

I am working on a DiskSim project in which I have to optimize a kind of algorithm in order to obtain the best average response time in the case of multiple? requests arriving at the same time. 
DiskSim has a lot of embedded algorithms (FCFC, SCAN, SSTF, etc.) and I need just one of them to modify/optimize and, if possible, embed in DiskSim (I suppose I must modify the source files and recompile DiskSim). This sounds pretty complicated.? 

Can anyone please provide some information about my issue? Actually, the two issues, first which algorithm should I modify (which one should be the easiest and quickest to modify, and second, if it ispossible to embed the optimized algorithm in DiskSim, and maybe how to do that :). 

Thank you in advance, 
All the best!

Message-ID: <002a01c9fffb$2fc2cea0$8f486be0$@net>

Hello,

 

I believe you are referring to the Scheduling Policy described in section
3.4.7 of the Disksim 4.0 users manual and the table of options listed on
page 29.

 

This scheduling policy is handled in the file disksim_ioqueue.c.  When you
set a value for "Scheduling Policy", it ends up in the member variable
.sched_alg of the ioqueue struct.  (Look at the function
DISKSIM_IOQUEUE_SCHEDULING_POLICY_loader in disksim_ioqueue_param.c.)

 

Perhaps you could add your own scheduling algorithm to disksim_ioqueue.c.

 

Once you have made your edits, rebuilding the source is as simple as running
"make".  Note: I have found it necessary to run "make clean" before
rebuilding when I make updates to an included module such as the ssd module.

 

Hope that helps,

 

David Maung

Hi!

I am trying to use dixtrac to extract parameters for a disk. I am running into some problems when I try to execute the new_disk.pl script. I ran it with perl and I get an error that says something like: Could not set FORCE_PACK_ID on device /dev/sda. Does anyone know what this means? Actually, has anyone used dixtrac tool successfully and can give me a walkthrough?

Subject: [Disksim-users] slave mode and request completion
Message-ID: <880811.83649.qm@web55106.mail.re4.yahoo.com>


In slave mode, can the master simulator give disksim a second request before disksim has finished processing a previous one?

If so, then how does the master know which request completed, when disksim calls its completion function?

In my code, the completion function completion(t, *req, *ctx) returns garbage values in req and ctx is null.

Or should I be using iface->ctx to point to the request currently being processed by disksim? If so, then disksim cannot handle more than one request at a time. 

Any enlightening comments welcome.

Thanks.

Hi,

I need to add dummy writes (writing to the same block twice with the same
value) to some device (e.g. the shadowed device) of RAID. I copied the
write request and added it in logorg_shadowed. When the dummy write has
the same block number as the original one, the program failed at some
point. With different block number, it is working fine.
I've been debugging with it for some time but no luck so far. Any ideas
what can go wrong when adding dummy writes with same block number? I've
removed the check for request already present in queue.

Thanks

Subject: [Disksim-users] Negative transfer time in Seagate Cheetah 15k.5
 disk spec
Message-ID: <4A3828F5.7030101@cs.nctu.edu.tw>

Hi,

I have the same query about the negative transfer time. A negative value 
seems to lead the zero transfer time when the bus transfer time is zero.

I think the time should approximate 0.005 ms

According to the spec of the hard disk: 
http://www.seagate.com/docs/pdf/datasheet/disc/ds_cheetah_15k_5.pdf ,
the sustained transfer rate of SEAGATE_ST3146855FC is between 73 to 125. 
If we assume the sustain transfer rate is 99, or (73+125)/2, then the 
bulk sector transfer time would be 512/(99*1024*1024) = 4.932 * 10-6 s.

Does anyone have some idea for the problem?

Thanks,
Weafon

Subject: [Disksim-users] k-client problem
Message-ID: <663467.83486.qm@web30105.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Good day everybody. I would like to ask you for some hints and pieces of advice about a project that I have for obtaining my Bachlor's Degree dipoloma. My project is called "Disk space administration in the case of the k-client problem". The k-client problem reffers to having multiple threads or processes requesting acces to the disk. So in essence this is a concurrency problem. 
What I would like to ask is how do I emphasize the k-client problem using DiskSim 4.0? I have also studied some disk access algorithms. Can anyone give me some hints? I suppose I will need to create a parameter file to simulate a disk in order to emphasize the k-client problem. 
Awaiting for your reply, thank you in advance. All the best!

I think you should emphasize on the "disk space management", not the
k-client problem.

In disksim, you can create a trace file, in which the time slots among
multiple I/O requests are small enough or approach to zero.

You may notice that disksim support the following case: the arrive time of
two or more I/O request can be equal to each other.

So I think generate the trace you needed and then try to propose a new
efficient disk space managenet approch to reduce the average response time
or improve the throughput under the k-client currency situation.

Best wishes!

Alternately, you might be able to configure multiple generators in a
disksim's synthetic workload generator component, with one per "client".

You should cozy up to the user manual, given your specific target.

Good luck!

Hello disksimmers!

Suppose disksim is used in slave mode by a system simulator.

Suppose a request is sent to disksim using the disksim_interface_request_arrive() function.

Can this function be called again (i.e., can another request be sent in) before disksim has indicated completion of the previous request through the callback?

If not, then is it necessary that requests be queued up by the system level simulator until disksim is ready for the next one?

Thank you.

yes, it can be called again. This is like the interruption call.

Yes.  the callback routines will be called multiple times. I suggest that you should refer to two source files: the src/syssim_driver.c and src/syssim_driver.h.

Tell me if any further progress.

Disksimmers!

Another follow-up question:

? When disksim reports completion, it uses a function with the following signature:
void* (SysTime t, struct disksim_request *r, void *ctx)

? What does it return (if anything useful) in *r and *ctx? Preliminary tests show that r does not appear to contain details about the request that was completed by disksim. 

Thank you.

Subject: [Disksim-users] splicing extra requests to simulation
Message-ID: <c9c83c680906291044y3f386d76l733bc74233e87585@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I wan't to add some extra r/w requests during a trace driven simulation.
Currently what I do is, I create a ioreq_event structure and feed it to
disksim_simulate_event() function.  The disksim_run_simulation() function
iteratively calls disksim_simulate_event().  So, on some conditions, that
function would call disksim_simulate_event(event), where 'event' is my
ioreq_event.  Otherwise it would call disksim_simulate_event(NULL), in which
case it takes the normal execution path of getting an event from trace and
executing it.

My problem is, after my extra requests are executed, when a normal request
is starting to execute, I get an error

disksim_controller.c:364: controller_bus_delay_complete: Assertion
`trv->next == curr' failed

I think when I change the request flow, there is some mismatch in the stats
maintained by controller structure (controller->buswait).

Can anyone tell me what is the best way to splice extra requests to the
simulation ? Or if I already do things correctly, please let me know how to
get around such kind of errors..

Thank you very much,
Krithika.

you can write a system level simulator with disksim as a slave module. Your problem will get easier.

	

All the best.

hi all,

i'm new with disksim. i try to run the example command in the manual that is:

./disksim parms.1B stdout ascii t.Jan6 0 "disk1 .. disk16" "Segment size (in
blks)" 64 "disk*" "Scheduler:Scheduling policy" 4

but it give the output like this:

*** Output file name: stdout
*** Input trace format: ascii
Tracefile t.Jan6 cannot be opened for read access

can someone help me point out where that i'm going wrong?

thank you in advance.

regards,
lizarazu.

Message-ID: <5F2196B1-FA2D-467D-BEB6-73EB2A6227A2@gmail.com>

Hello,

Well, I solved the problems with the ascii traces :) .

Now, I want to include Cache in this tests.
Do I need to change the bus type?? I use a trace that makes 100  
requests to the same block, but I didn?t see any changes in the *.outv.

these are the results without cache:

Disk number of buffer accesses : 99

Disk buffer hit ratio : 93
Disk buffer miss ratio : 6

I think It is wrong because is the same all the time.

Can you help me?


thank you

Dear all,

I intended to use Cello-99 traces as the DiskSim traces. But the traces are
the srt, fs and ps format. How to convert them to the suitable trace format
which the DiskSim can work?

I have tried to adding suppoort for new trace formats in
"disksim_iotrace.c", but I don't know how to do it? Would you please tell me
how to ?
Thank you very much!

Hi,

I am compiling Disksim 3.0 with GCC 4.1.2 on my 32-bit systems (IA32
and AMD32) running CentOS 5.2

Note: I implemented a scheduling algorithm on Disksim 3.0. That's why
I need to stay with it, at least for now.

Does anyone have a clue? Please help.

I got a lot of error messages in the screen output. I grep'ed them and
pasted as below. I got exact the same screen output on both IA32 and
AMD32 systems.

Subject: [Disksim-users]  Having problem using TPC-C trace with Disksim
Message-ID: <526105.81024.qm@web110801.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I am using TPC-C trace but I am not able to make it work. LBA in TPC-C trace is very large than the range of the unsigned long int. How can I make this trace environment suitable to simulation environment? I tried changing the value of 'locScale' in I/O mappings block in parameter file but it doesn't work for me.

For example:

Request 1:    3247.201        0       276996096       3       0
It gives following error:

unexpected request location: devno 0, blkno 276996096, bcount 3

Assertion failed:
simtime  = 3247.201000
totalreqs        = 1
disksim: disksim_logorg.c:763: logorg_maprequest: Assertion `logorgno != -1' failed.
Aborted


Request 2:    5288.554        0       3201773568      16      0
It gives the following error:

unexpected request location: devno 0, blkno 2147483647, bcount 16

Assertion failed:
simtime  = 5288.554000
totalreqs        = 1
disksim: disksim_logorg.c:763: logorg_maprequest: Assertion `logorgno != -1' failed.
Aborted


In the second request, LBA value gets rounded in the range of long int. How can I fix this problem?

Thank you!

Unfortunately, the SSD add-on does not include logic to simulate an in-memory cache.

I would hope that a cache could be added as a layer on top of the SSD add-on rather than embedding cache code in the SSD module itself.  It's even possible that existing disk-cache code could be adapted for this purpose.

Best of luck,

 Hi

I have downloaded the specification of Seagate Cheetah 15k.5 disk from the
"on-line database of disk parameters" provided by the disksim team. The
disksim_disk block in file Seagate-Cheetah15k5.diskspecs specifies the disk
transfer time as follows:
Bulk sector transfer time = -0.015000

Does anyone have any idea why the transfer time is negative? (The Bus and
Controller transfer times are specified as zero).

Thanks in advance,

Hi:

I am working with DiskSim and have run across couple of problems.  Are there known fixes to these issues:
I am running Debian Linux with g++ version 3.4.3.

The first issue I ran into is that during compile, disksim_iosim.c, line 712:  StaticAssert (sizeof(ioreq_event) <= DISKSIM_EVENT_SIZE)
returns an error:  disksim_iosim.c: In function `io_initialize':
disksim_iosim.c:712: error: duplicate case value
disksim_iosim.c:712: error: previously used here


My guess is that the most probable cause for this error is an enumeration problem with ioreq_event in disksim_iosim.h.  However, I am not sure what the correct fix is.

After working around the first issue by making sizeof(ioreq_event) a constant, then I run into an issue trying to execute runvalid.  The disksim.c core dumps and points out the enclosed atlas_III.parv parameter file as invalid format.  I checked the format with the user manual and it seemed to have all required elements.  The filename also is consistent within disksim_global.h.  So why is disksim.c crashing?


Thanks


Luke

Hello,

I?m testing Disk response Time with cheetah4LP.

By default the scheduling algorithm in diskspecs is 1 FCFS, I changed  
this value to 7 to test SSTF Disk response TIme but the results are  
the same:

100 consecutive requests , read size = 1blk ===> Disk response Time =  
0.224548
100 non consecutive requests, read size = 1blk ===> Disk Response Time  
= 1.245206


is It correct?

must I change de size if request to see changes in times??

thank you

Hi,

cheetah4LP disk only has on-disk queue length 1, so no matter what 
scheduling algorithm used, the performance is the same.

You can observe different performance by changing the on-disk maximal 
queue length in diskspecs file.

Hello,

I have been looking to create an embedded solution, and your Disk Simulator
project, or at least a part of it,  looks like it may be what I need.


I am interested mostly in the hardware used in your project. I need only
simulate an IDE or SATA Disk, that would ultimately connect to  a Samba or
NFS share. From what I read that came out of Berkeley, it runs an unmodified
version of Linux. I also saw some images of a board that came from UC
Berkeley, but I can not find any details about the hardware that was used
there either. Do you know of any similar prototype platforms? Can you
provide details or links to what you use?

Thanks,

Mark de Leon Martinez

I do not know of my last post did not make it to the list so I will make a
similar post hgere after having waited.

I need to set up DiskSIM with IDE or SATA (preferrably IDE) interfaces. I
understand that a SCSI host adapter may be no different than a ASCI device,
however I do not know if this applies to the workd of ATA and SATA as well.

If anyone he45e can please clarify what hardware  I need to emulate an ATA
and SATA interface I would very much appreciate it




Thanks,

When I referred to "ASCI", it was a typo and should have read "SCSI"

My interest is more in hardware to emulate an IDE or ATA interface

Hi Mark,
If I understand correctly, what you need is a hareware emulator for
disk drives. In that case, disksim is definitely not for you.

No, it simulates the timings, but without any real data behind it.  
AFAIU disksim takes I/O access patterns and returns estimated timings  
for various storage systems (or single platters).

> My intention is to actually emulate a disk via a network interface.

Does that emulated disk require some sort of cycle accurate timings  
WRT some real disk or storage system? That's probably the only point  
where disksim could be of use for you.

I don't consider an "old IDE host controller" to be an emulation. It's  
just an IDE controller. If it suffices, you don't need to emulate  
anything, do you?

If you are really more into hardware, you might want to look at  
various VHDL or Verilog projects on OpenCores, they provide some sort  
of IDE (i.e. ATA) controller at [1].

Hi Mark

Disksim is only a simulator, NOT an emulator.  There was a related
project at CMU called The Memulator which used Disksim to provide
timing-accuracy for a memory-based storage emulator:

http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/ftp/Storage/timing_abs.html

Memulator is not part of the Disksim code, but there is a snapshot
available: http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~griffin2/memulator-3.0-release.tar.gz.
 All the normal caveats apply to the code - it is unsupported, I
haven't actually used it myself, so unfortunately I can't give you any
help in getting it working.

Subject: [Disksim-users] Need some help on modeling disk
Message-ID: <4bb46c4d0910151925k2fb581f1n8d1413bfa0c40f5@mail.gmail.com>

I'm doing some research on improving I/O performance of Xen and I want to
get some data on the overhead of different types of hard disk.
I have read the disksim4-manual, but I don't know what those paraments on
disk, buses, controller should be and there are little infomation on the
internet showing how to do so.
I need help on modeling different disk type according to performance . I
also want to know where should I get the paraments required by disksim4 from
different types of disks.

Thanks in advance.
Ted.

Subject: [Disksim-users] Regarding simulation of events in ssd model disksim
Message-ID: <63e51aa0909021025v3487a06auc1f8e33ccd397ab2@mail.gmail.com>

I started using the ssd model of disksim simulator a couple of weeks back
and I have gone through the call stack of the functions that were called
after a request from the parameter file was read. I have debugged the
program to trace the function calls for a few requests that were handled, I
have a couple of doubts of how things are really simulated in the ssd
simulator. Firstly, I notice that the simulator handles function on a per
request basis. In the actual model requests come in all the time that are
buffered at the controller level to be handled later. Also, two or more
requests may be interleaved. I haven't seen how this behavior is simulated
in the model and its always like the call returns back to
disksim_simulate_event(event_count) function where the next request is
handled sequentially

Also, how is the time tracked for interleaved events. If there 4 requests
that were interleaved completely, the simulation time will be the time taken
for 1 request (rather than 4). So, where is the check being made to check if
an event's simulation time should be added to the total simulation time or
if it was a parallel operation. It might also be possible that an even was
partially interleaved , in which case only a fractin of time for that event
has to be added to the total simulation time instead of the complete time

Thanks

Subject: [Disksim-users] new_disk.pl and dx_track errors
Message-ID: <20090906093305.hlqk5n9qssc0c808@mail.uoc.gr>

Hello all.

I was wondering if anyone has run the new_disk.pl or the dx_trac  
executable because when I run both I get this error:

Could not set FORCE_PACK_ID on device /dev/sdXX

Does anyone know the solution to that?I would appreciate it!

P.S.0:dx_trac runs as dx_stat -d <disk dev>
Is the disk parameter mandatory?Whenever I run it with the disk  
parameter I get an error:

Device XX...XX not defined or no R/W permissions.

Without I get the referenced FORCE_PACK_ID error.
Any ideas?

After some debugging I found out that the error is generated from file  
build_scsi.c in line 153.Adding some diagnostic code the ioctl  
function returns -1 and I get the errno error description  
"Inappropiate ioctl for device".Here is the modified code:

   ictl_val = 0;
   int res;
   errno = 0;
   if ( 0 > ( res = ioctl(fd,SG_SET_FORCE_PACK_ID,&ictl_val) ) ) {
     printf("Printing FORCE_PACK_ID:%0x\n", SG_SET_FORCE_PACK_ID);
     printf("ioctl returned:%d ERRNO returned:%s\n", res, strerror(errno));
     error_handler("Could not set FORCE_PACK_ID  on device %s \n",devname);
   }

Does anyone have any idea as to what am I doing wrong?It perfectly  
finds devices such as sg0 which is a CD/DVD-ROM but it can't find any  
device labeled sdaX or sdbX...

You are building on a 64 bit machine.  You need to add -m32 to your build
flags, or build on a 32-bit machine.

Hi Sajen

I used DiskSim with SimOS in around 1999.  Unfortunately, SimOS is
more than a decade out of date today, as it was originally developed
for the MIPS and Alpha architectures.  If you need to do full-system
simulation with a more modern architecture, I would look at Simics or
Bochs.  It should be pretty straightforward to make DiskSim work as an
emulated device for these systems.

Hi All,
  I am a little comfused about ASU in the SPC trace of in  UMASS repository.

  For instance, the trace in Financial1.trace,
0,303567,3584,w,0.000000
1,55590,3072,w,0.000000
0,303574,3584,w,0.026214
1,240840,3072,w,0.026214
 If I wanna transfer it to an ASCII trace, I just choose the lines of ASU 0?


  If this trace is running on a single disk, so the access of the
requests is interleaving at the disk?

Thanks a lot!

Dear Alireza,

Thank you for your attention. I did use the command "    patch -p1 <
ssdmodel/ssd-patch"

Some of the modification can be loaded automatically,  while some are not. I
need to modify the file of DiskSim manually.

Thanks,

Yangyang

Hi all,

 I am using the SSD package in DiskSim. In the simulation result,  I want to
find how many times the Flash has been erased and the endurance of the
Flash. Which parameter I should use to get the information I need?  Please
drop me a message if you have found the information. Thank you very much.

Hello Yangyang,

You should be able to find the information inside the output files generated by disksim.

Try searching for:

Number of cleans:

	/include/disksim/modules parameters files.
Message-ID: <AANLkTimyObD6g-GBMTZDEa+UwC7X_oBE3-t4aSCEu4mE@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

As the Disksim Manual says, the parameter can be changed. However, I change
the parameters in the /include/disksim/modules parameters files. Then I use
the commands
"make clean" and " make", the parameters in the /include/disksim/modules
parameters files return the original values.

So does anybody know how to change the parameter?  Please drop me a message.
I will be very appreciated. Thank you very much.

I suspect the parameter files you are looking at are part of the build
process and are overwritten and are not the parameter files you are looking
for.  The files that are loaded during the simulation are the .layout,
.parv, and .model files.  I recommend looking at those.

Best wishes,

Hi everyone,

I am using the SSD extention now. There are only two ascii traces in the
package, which is sensitive to the number of parallel planes.

However, the synthetic traces are not sensitive to the number of parallel
planes. So I want to find more real workload traces.  Such as the traces
from the University of Maryland, and the traces on
http://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Storage/Storage.

But when I run the traces, there are always errors about the mapping or "can
not find some blno  " or "disksim: disksim_logorg.c:763: logorg_maprequest:
Assertion `logorgno != -1' failed. Aborted "  or " Segmentation fault".

So does anyone have suggestion for this problem? Thank you very much.

Best,
Yangyang

Subject: [Disksim-users] query
Message-ID: <BAY148-ds9C8EDD0B50F6CCD6B71AC86970@phx.gbl>


    Recently I have used the cache function of the disksim, but I have a query about the cachedev function(I want to use the cachedev function). In the valid file of the disksim, when we use the disksim running the single disk(not simpledisk) module(topology 1), the response time is 11.788649, but when use the disksim running the synthcachedev.parv file(topology 2) to complete a disk cache disk structure, the response time is 22.834661, why the response times of topology 2 is large than topology 1, and the difference is so clearly, almost twice. So I want to know where is the cache work, and the using meaning of cache.
   Futhermore I want to know whether the cachedev only support the disk module and not support the simpledisk module.
   Thank you! 
  Best regard!

This happens when your request are arriving too soon.  For example, you may issue a large number of requests in a small time interval.  Disksim can't handle all of these requests so the simulation is halted.  A solution would be to increase the time between the requests.

Just to add a bit of color: DiskSim (the simulator) doesn't have a problem
with large numbers of requests, but early on we learned that an exploding
number of outstanding requests indicates something wrong -- either an input
trace with an arrival rate far higher than the storage system can serve or
a misconfiguration that results in NO requests completing.  So, we put in
a saturation threshold to avoid extremely long runs with no meaningful
output.

Hello All,
   I am pretty new to the DiskSim tool. I compiled it and ran the
example in valid folder. This looks correct. 
But now, I have added a SCSI disk, I created partitions on the disk and
I see that I am able to mount it and write to it.
 
 
I am trying to run Dixtrac as:
./new_disk.pl /dev/sdb scsi_disk:6:0:0:0 test1
I get the error: Problems with ioctl on device /dev/sdb
 
However, I can mount /dev/sdb and read /write to it.
 
Please let me know if what I am doing is incorrect.
 
Thanks,
Padmini

Message-ID: <cb4cd3d1d1f96a223ab97b65f1bb78d5.squirrel@mail.mpi-sws.org>

Hello everyone,

I have been using DiskSim for a while and have found it to be a very
useful tool.  I am currently trying to extract and additional model, and I
am running it to some problems.  I'm not sure if anyone can help me with
this, but if you have any ideas or advice, please let me know.  My
detailed experience is below.  My high level question for the list, is if
you
have done a successful extraction, what setup (Disk, OS version, Python,
gcc versions, etc) did you have? As I would be interested in replicating
the setup as best I can.  It is important to me that I have both an
extracted model, and the physical hardware so that
I can do experiments on both.

I would appreciate any help that someone might be able to provide,

Thanks,

Ansley

--- Details of problem below ------

To start I run the initial scripts to set up the directory, and
then run 'make extract', it takes a while to build the layout.mappings
file and then begins to make the passes over it.  The first problem
I have is the following, while running the python scripts I got the
following exception:

~/Projects/disksim-4.0/diskmodel/layout_g4_tools/g4_analysis.py:38:
DeprecationWarning: the sets module is deprecated
  from sets import Set
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "~/Projects/disksim-4.0/diskmodel/layout_g4_tools/g4_analysis.py",
line 491, in <module>
    idx = outer(lin)
  File
"/home/abpost/Projects/disksim-4.0/diskmodel/layout_g4_tools/g4_analysis.py",
line 445, in outer
    if i > lastgood+1:
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'lastgood' referenced before assignment

Looking at the code, there does exist a code path for which this variable
is undeclared.  So to try fixing it, I've put a declaration in.  This
might be the wrong thing to do, but it allows me to go a bit further. 
After doing this the process manages to build a few more files, and then
fails once it tries to run dx_seek with the following error:

~/Projects/disksim-4.0/dixtrac/dx_seeks --mode=mtbrc --cyl=1 --cylstep=1
--cylmax=100 -d /dev/sg2 -l base-ibm-2.model -s seeks.1
Disk (/dev/sg2): IBM IC35L036UWD210-0, rev. S5CQ, SCSI-3, SN:VMZD4790
 ------- Internal error -------
diskinfo_get_rand_cyl: tried 50 times, giving up.
dx_seeks: dxtools.c:127: internal_error: Assertion `internal_error == 0'
failed.
Aborted

I've stepped through this with gdb, and don't see anything obvious, but
I'm not an expert.  This violation could be the result of adding the
variable in the previous step.

Hello,
        Does anyone who confront the problem like me. If someone know these problem, please give me some help.
        My problem is as follows:
        I want to add some more function to disksim. But when I add some code and make, run, the disksim can not work correctly.
        I have use the gdb debug tool to affirm my  problem is belongs to gcc compile tool. The problem is show in two parts:
        1.The parameter transfer in the function is changed automatic, it leading to the running error.
        2. And some code (which i add ) can not be compiled, even if the condition is 1.
        Can anyone give me answer, I would be very appreciate.
        Thanks!

Subject: [Disksim-users] Getting FlashSim to work with DiskSim3.0
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=wpt6BdbEEZm43rYDpsBzU-QY54ENWmx5r-Foh@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I am trying to use FlashSim in conjunction with DiskSim3.0. High-level
procedures to set this up are described here:

http://csl.cse.psu.edu/?q=node/322

This will provide me with an environment to simulate DFTL, Page Mapping FTL,
and FAST.

The first step is to get DiskSim3.0 installed and working. I was able to get
DiskSim3.0 installed, configured, and compiled successfully using the
procedures that are posted here:

http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/DiskSim/Compiling_DiskSim3.0_v1.0.pdf

However, I was not sure how to complete the remaining steps on
http://csl.cse.psu.edu/?q=node/322 to get FlashSim working correctly. The
instructions say to extract src.release.tar.gz which I did. But am I
supposed to get rid of my existing (and correctly functioning)
~/disksim-3.0/src directory and replace it with the src.release directory? I
wasn't sure if I should get rid of it or copy over it with the new
src.release contents.

Also, after that is resolved, what is the proper command I should use to
correctly "make" the files?

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks.
Jonathan

All,

Here is an update with the exact error message I get. So after I have
DiskSim 3.0 working, I backed up the DiskSim src directory:
cd ~/disksim/disksim-3.0
mv src src_orig

I then put src.release (from FlashSim) to src (in DiskSim directory):
cp -pR /tmp/src.release ~/disksim/disksim-3.0/src

I updated my .paths and .paths.in accordingly inside
~/disksim/disksim-3.0/src:
#update the LIBPARAM_PREFIX and LIBDDBG_PREFIX in the .paths.in file to have
path of disksim directory
export LIBPARAM_PREFIX=/home/jontjioe/disksim/disksim-3.0/libparam
export LIBDDBG_PREFIX=/home/jontjioe/disksim/disksim-3.0/libddbg
export DISKMODEL_PREFIX=/home/jontjioe/disksim/disksim-3.0/diskmodel

cp .paths.in .paths

And then, I run the patch which updates dftl.c, disksim_logorg.c, fast.c,
flash.c, pagemap.c, and syssim_driver.c:
 cd ~/disksim/disksim-3.0/src
patch -p1 -i flashsim-20100324.patch

I then attempted to compile the src directory:
cd ~/disksim/disksim-3.0/src
make

 This is the error I get:

Greeting All

I am new to DiskSim ...

Can any one tell me which specific resource will help me understand how to
modify the IOdriver model of disksim in order to simulate hybrid storage
system (Disk + SSD) that is managed by the Operating System.

Your help is highy appreciated ....

Two issues:
1) You are getting a segmentation fault, because you are trying to 
implement a hybrid system using magnetic and SSD drives. Due to a bug in 
the disksim code, getssd will use the current disk index as an index 
into the table of ssd disks.
So if there are three magnetic disks, and one SSD, when trying to access 
disk 3 (the SSD), it will try to getssd(3). But since the count of SSDs 
is only 1, it will fall off the table.

To avoid this, keep your system purely SSD apply the second patch to 
your config.

2) Once this is bypassed, the code will fail on an assertion that your 
page size does not match the aligned count as returned by 
ssd_choose_aligned_count. The value that function returns is MIN(count, 
block number % page size). If count is 4 and page size is 8, you will 
have problems.

I don't know what that means for your experiments, but you can either 
change page size to 4 or apply the first patch. The patch will ignore 
the difference.

Good luck,
Michael.

All,

If any of you use FlashSim, I made a guide and also updated the src files so
you need very little modification. If you already have DiskSim 3.0 working,
with the attached files, you get get FlashSim working in minutes.

Hope this is helpful for you.

Hi all,

I am new to DiskSim.
When I compile DiskSim 4.0 on the 64bit machine, I added -m32 to

 $(CC) -c -m32 $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@

Then I encountered these compilation erros

Subject: [Disksim-users] DiskSim 4.0 with SSD extension compiling error on
	64bit machine
Message-ID: <AANLkTimS+K3o8pauNM0OYXqxznj330QDT9PJjuMBwZ6h@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I've downloaded the DiskSim4_0_diff_patch and succeeded in compilation.
But when I tried to extend to SSD, and patch the ssd.patch, I still get some
warnings and errors for compile.

Hi,

Has anyone has a solution on compile DiskSim 4.0 with SSD extension on 64
bit?
If I patch both disksim 4.0 patch and ssd patch, the compilation still
fails. But disksim 4.0 standalone compilation will succeed.

Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP204C8B6EE02E875FC2EE68AC7180@phx.gbl>

Dear users,

In order to simulate I/O accesses of an application on Disksim, we
need the block-level I/O traces of that application. How can I
generate such a trace for an application running on an x86, x86-64, or
PowerPC system?

Thank you very much!

Regards,
Yipkei

Hello,
        Can someone can send me some trace file for ssd simulation, for example Financial, WebSearch, etc?
        I have download the Fanancial trace file from the "UMass Trace Repository" Website, but I don't know how to use it, because I don't konw how to change the trace file to fit my SSD simulation model size.
        Thanks!

You need to :
1. Write new trace interface ( DiskSim manual will help you to do so)
2. Compress block addresses in UMass trace files to fit into your SSD size.

1. I am not sure if it is the correct way I compression, However you can
compress each address that exceed the total block address limit in your SSD.

2. You mean that ASU field represent the disk number for each request ? If
you mean this, I think It is better to filter request from one disk and feed
them in new trace file to disksim.

Message-ID: <C6A64D82E3A5D24B949315CFBC1FA1AD07FE4081BB@DEWDFECCR01.wdf.sap.corp>

Hello,

For the research purpose I plan to use DiskSim in a full system level simulator, where the simulator should simulate access to several disks spread over LAN network.
Basically I look for a way to use DiskSim to simulate several disks spread over the LAN network. I had a look at "disksim_interface.c" and found that disksim is a global variable, so it is probably impossible to instantiate several disksim instances in the same processe. Another (unpleasant) option may be to create several processes - where each process is dedicated to instantiating one disksim instance. This option is complex to manage.

Here is my question: is there a simpler way to simulate several disks?

Thanks in advance,

Roman

Hello

I think you should model all characteristics of your network in disksim and
then connect your storage network model ( in this case disksim interface) to
your full system simulator.

Hello,

I am new to Disksim.  I read the manual.  I have a question about compiling the API.

I noticed that there syssim_drive.c is a good skeleton for creating an API.  I am trying to experiment with some of the options of Disksim by modifying the syssim_drive.  I also have the Microsoft SSD patch installed.

Here is my question, how do I compile syssim_drive.c?

I have tried using the following gcc command:

gcc syssim_drive.c disksim_interface.o libdisksim.a -o test

I get errors as expected but I don't know how to proceed.  Any help would be appreciated!

 Hi Steve,

Thank you for your reply.  I have seen the syssim_driver.c file. However, I am unable to compile the syssim_driver.c file into anexecutable.  I realize that there is a syssim executable file already,but I want to made modifications to the syssim_driver.c file so that Ican experiment with the environment. 

Any help would be appreciated!

you can call disksim module in your program via four disksim APIs:
disksim_interface_initialize,
disksim_interface_request_arrive,

 Hey Steve,

Yes, I do see the syssim executable.

However, I would like to make my own executable.  Basically, after copying and pasting syssim_driver.c,
and modifying it a tad,into a different file, let's call it a.c, I want to compile a.c into an executable.  
This is my current situation.  Any help with compiling a.c into an executable would be helpful!

Thanks for your time!

Hello,mauricxe,

    It looks good. you need compile disksim together with your simulator.



All the best.

you can always do make in the syssim directory after changing syssim.
that should make syssim again.

Subject: [Disksim-users] Device Caching for Arrays
Message-ID: <D9516795-4E46-4220-8675-0DB3C6DC7935@virginia.edu>

I'm attempting to create an array (probably similar to a raid5) in DiskSim (4.0) and have device caching.  The ideal model will involve using an SSD as a cache for multiple drives in the array.

I've installed and patched with the SSD plugin, but am having trouble forcing DiskSim to use the device caching properly. It seems hard to have a device cache for multiple devices.


Taken from the sample/reading the manual I need something like this in a controller:

 Cache = disksim_cachedev { 
     Cache size = 2056008,
     Cache device = cache_disk,    # device we're caching on
     Cached device = disk,         # device that's being cached
     Max request size = 512,
     Write scheme = 3,
     Flush policy = 0,
     Flush period = 0.0,
     Flush idle delay = 100.0
 },  # end of cachedev spec  

However, it seems I'd have to create a custom controller for each device, and the result would be many caches for an array.  

Any one have any experience with this, or advice for a direction to pursue?

-Sean

You can try commenting that line out.

Message-ID: <264c01951002261156r424c4e3ao8616374e6ea18801@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We are working on the effects of different placement strategies to the
performance of our system. In our system, we need to place different blocks
to different disks and make some simulations. Can we do this by using
DiskSim? As far as I understood, this is controlled in DiskSim by the trace
file assuming that the disks have all the blocks that they can store and if
we tell to disksim that;
"read block # X from disk A", it assumes that, that block X is stored in
disk A. But if we have a one disk array logical organization lets say with 3
disks and we want specific blocks to be stored in specific disks such that;

blocks 1, 5 ,7 are stored in disk 0
blocks 11, 23 are stored in disk 1
block 18 is stored in disk 2
..
..

all the other blocks are randomly placed, then can we do this by adding our
own function similar to the function "logorg_mapstriped (logorg *currlogorg,
ioreq_event *curr)" into disksim_logorg.c file?

Thanks in advance,

You'll need to dig into the code, obviously, but that ought to be
possible.

Disksim 4.0 does not support 64-bit os. you can build it on a 32-bit machine.

Good Luck,

Hi,

When I try applying your patch without adding the ssd code, I get the
following issues when running:

1) I still have to comment out an assert line in the disksim initialize
function.
2) When I do that and do run it, I get the following errors:

Subject: [Disksim-users]  Temporary force-to-32-bit from 64-bit patches
Message-ID: <52eb19731001200739j37892dy1aca149fcf545bee@mail.gmail.com>

So, I have 2 patches that make disksim and disksim-with-dixtrac run on
64bit.  They are attached.

The summary-force building of the packages to use 32bit libraries.

This should hold out until there is a reliable disksim 64-bit patch or
version.

Best wishes,
--Marlow

Subject: [Disksim-users] Has anyone used DIXtrac?
Message-ID: <AANLkTik9mPUysBU3CYhdnFRHPr0m8xRMxqN0p5OjxsIU@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm pretty new to Disksim. Recently I met some problems when I was running
DIXtrac on CentOS 5.1 to model the 8GB SCSI disk on VMWare.

I followed what DIXtrac says to extract the local disk model. The first
problem is when doing the disk layout mapping, it shows "Cannot handle
defect list format (0)". So I looked into the code and commented out the
"read_defect_list" function in that hope that it still works correctly. But
after then I met the second problem. When I'm running pass0.py, the program
kept running all the time (it didn't finish after several days). I think it
may because the python program has used up too big memory, since it stores
the entire content of "layout.mappings" to the object "lout". But the
layout.mappings file is usually in the scale of gegabyte, which the memory
can not deal with. To verify my guessing, I tried the small layout.mappings
files, and this time pass0.py works well.

These problems have confused me for a couple of weeks. If anyone have used
DIXtrac, could you please help me? I will really appreciate it. Thank you
very much!

Perhaps I am misunderstanding, but you should not expect DIXtrac to
successfully characterize a virtual disk.

Thank you so much for your reply. I will try it on real SCSI disks.

Hi all,

I want to run the simulation for a long time, however I trace file is not
large enough and I do not want to use the synthetic trace.

Does anyone know how to run a trace file repeatly?

Also, if you have any better trace sources for SSD, would you please send me
the link? I will be very appreciated for your help.

Thank you very much.

Best,

Hi, all

I use disksim to run a intensive trace. There is a very strange problem that I come to:
As we know, the controller type 3 can have cache there.
I fI use type 3 controller with a cache to run the trace, there is a sudden stop of simulation with following message:
   "Stopping simulation because of saturation: simtime 143242.140000, totalreqs 103433"
I know this message comming from file disksim_logorg.c with the outstanding value bigger than 10000.

But when I use the type 1 controller, which is no cache, but directly send the request down or up. It can successfully run without any problems.

In my view, with a cache, the throughput shoud  be bigger, and it should not saturation compared with no cache.

This is strange. If any one comes to this question, pls share with me, thank you very much.

(Someone has shared that this is because throughput, but with no cache, it is OK. I think this is not the ture reason.)

Hi, all,

The problem has been solved. The reason for the time saturation is that request size in the intensive trace is larger than that of cache can solve.
Two appoarches can be applied to solve the problem:
   1 change the size of max request size
   2 change the large size request into small sequential ones.

I think these solutions can be good for those who think that throughput of disksim is not OK for high throughput applications.

Hello, everyone,

I come to a new problem. I wander if anyone comes to it before.

When I use disksim with its synthetical trace input parameter, I come to the result that:

Idle process has been running for more than 50 seconds

and then disksim stop. This sentence is in the disksim_pfsim.c.
An interesting problem that I found is when I use the cache in the smart controller with setting the bit granularity with 4, this result would sure to happen.

Hope anyone can help me. Thank you.

Hi,
I've just downloaded disksim 4.0 and executed makefile.
I've go the following errors:

gcc -Wall -Wno-unused -MD -c -I. -I../diskmodel/include
-I../libparam/include -I../libddbg/include -g -DASSERTS
-I../memsmodel/include -D_INLINE  disksim_iosim.c -o disksim_iosim.o

make[1]: *** [disksim_iosim.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/olgab/Desktop/disksim-4.0/src'
make: *** [all] Error 2

What is the problem? I've checked the line 712, there is no case statement
there ...


Best regards,

Hi Olga,

There is a macro
-- disksim_iosim.c: L712
StaticAssert (sizeof(ioreq_event) <= DISKSIM_EVENT_SIZE);

-- disksim_global.h: L244
#define StaticAssert(c) switch (c) case 0: case (c):

In a 64bit OS. sizeof(ioreq_event) > DISKSIM_EVENT_SIZE.

This bug could be fixed by a more accurate definition of ioreq_event data
fields.
Try to convert the 32-64bit sensitive data structures by marcos, like 'int'
-> 'int32'. Hope this could help.

typedef struct ioreq_ev {
   double time;
   int    type;
   struct ioreq_ev *next;
   struct ioreq_ev *prev;
   int    bcount;
   int    blkno;
   u_int  flags;
   u_int  busno;
   u_int  slotno;
   int    devno;
   int    opid;
   void  *buf;
   int    cause;
   int    tempint1;
   int    tempint2;
   void  *tempptr1;
   void  *tempptr2;
   void  *mems_sled; /* mems sled associated with a particular event */
   void  *mems_reqinfo; /* per-request info for mems subsystem */
   double start_time;    /* temporary; used for memulator timing */
   int    batchno;
   int    batch_complete;
   int    batch_size;
   struct ioreq_ev *batch_next;
   struct ioreq_ev *batch_prev;
} ioreq_event;

In the trace file, what is the unit of the request size?

Such as a request:
11567.363 0 1455680 1864 0

what does the 1864 mean?   1864KB or 1864*(512 byte) as 512byte is the size
of a sector?  Thank you very much.

All the Best

Subject: [Disksim-users] Question: linking DiskSim to OMNeT++
Message-ID: <AANLkTil1lV05Wi3UIVgOj-b6tRLmR9L3nrK7SL0eHAgo@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I tried to link DiskSim to OMNeT++, but after a week of struggling I still
haven't got it working.
I linked all the libraries (disksim, diskmodel, dxtools, st, ddbg, param and
memsmodel)  but got the following error:

.../lib/libddbg.a(ddbg_trace.o): In fuction 'ddbg_register':
.../ddbg_trace.c:95 undefined reference to 'bit_zero'
.../lib/libddbg.a(ddbg_trace.o): In fuction 'ddbg_enable':
.../ddbg_trace.c:110 undefined reference to 'bit_setall'
.../lib/libddbg.a(ddbg_trace.o): In fuction 'ddbg_disable':
.../ddbg_trace.c:123 undefined reference to 'bit_zero'
colllect2: ld returned 1 exit status

When I also link disksim_interface.o errors occur saying: multiple
definition of...
I'm using an own makefile, because the one generated by OMNeT doesn't
include the paths properly
(it first searches for a file and gets an error, before including the path
where this file is in).
I searched on the internet and tried lots of things, but I can't find what
I'm doing wrong. Do anyone have some advice?
I'd really appreciate it. Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Joep

Subject: [Disksim-users] using DiskSim package to simulate a disk only
Message-ID: <AANLkTikd02kGLai4R4vv0Oc_k3pNuVuiEXt7yiPZwh2j@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'd like to use DiskSim tool to simulate a disk (or collection of disks)
only: no drivers, controllers and such.
How do I do that?

I tried simply stating only disks and disks mapping in parv file, but I get
exception:
*assertion failed: in lp_instantiate() (util.c:585): spec != 0: no such type
simulation.*

Can you provide or refer me to an example parv file for disk simulation
only?

Best regards,

Olga Brukman

Leave those things in (can't take them out), but have them all be infinitely
fast (i.e., zero time for their work)... it is then as if they were not
there at all, in terms of simulation results.

	the way of trace acquisition
Message-ID: <e5f3edfc1003052252t4a488f4bg6c14e04de5dfb91f@mail.gmail.com>

question 1 :    i have read the manul ,and i want to use the disksim to
simulate a raid 5 system about reading and writing.
            in the manual ,i find that the parameter concerned with raid 5
is "redundancy scheme "in the section "disk array date organization" of the
manual
           and  i find  the file synthraid5.parv in the "valid" folder of
the disksim source code .however i can not find the configuration about raid
5 in                     the file.
            *how do the disksim make the data  stored in the way of raid 5?*
            *if i will reach my purpose ,which one in the "src" folder  of
the disksim source code should i change ??*

question 2 :     in a paper i find that the author use the trace of the
software " cpp ,andrew benchmark and wc"as a input to disksim
            [The C preprocessor (cpp) is the preprocessor for the C
programming language. ]
            [The Andrew benchmark is used to compare BFS with two other file
systems]
            [The wc command stands for " word count ]
            *how can i get the trace of the software ? utilise some tool??*

The answers to the first question:

The following combination in  synthraid5.parv  shows that you are using a
RAID5. For the reason, please see the manual.

   Distribution scheme = Striped,
   Redundancy scheme = Parity_rotated,


Please see the the function named logorg_maprequest() in disksim_logorg.c if
you want to make a deep analysis of the mechanism of RAID5.

I'm not aware of it being integrated, but there is no reason that it
could not be... would require effort.

I think a good way to work with Disk-Sim is using disk-trace that captured
from full system simulator like SIMICS, In the other word we can install a
guest OS on top of the SIMICS virtual machine. In this guest OS we can run
our disk-stressing benchmarks and try to monitor disk access trace in host
machine by the means of SIMICS API functions.

are there any comment or idea in this topic ?


Note that since GEMS is a well known memory system simulator based on
SIMICS, I don't think that it need or can be used with Disksim.

 Hello all,

I have a question about two of the numbers reported by Disksim at the end of a simulation.

Is my understanding of the following two metrics accurate?  If not, could you supplement my definition or point out what I am missing?


Access Time- Is this determined by a sum of the spin-up time, seek time, rotational delay, and transfer time?

Response Time-The amount of time it takes to issue the request and to receive the results.  This would also include Queue time. 

Is my understanding of these two accurate?

Thanks!!!!

It depends on which component you are looking at... those two metrics
are captured at every "level" of a configuration (disk, controller,
device driver).  In each case, the latter includes queue time and
the former does not.

Hello all,

I have another question :)

Can Disksim track energy consumption?  I didn't see anything inside themanual.  I am currently running the SSD model from microsoft.  Wouldthe power consumption statistics be their responsibility?

Thanks again!

Message-ID: <e5f3edfc1003220526p73a035f3u8a494982402ffdbd@mail.gmail.com>

hi disksim-users:
i am succeed in using the* gdb comand to* debug the disksim ...
but when i use the tool *codeblocks* to debug the disksim,,there are some
errors..
 for example
error:
            E:\coldblockdisksim\disksim-4.0\diskmodel\dm_load.c
            line 40   (  #include "*modules/modules.h*")
            *modules/modules.h*: No such file or directory

error:

         E:\coldblockdisksim\disksim-4.0\diskmodel\dm_load.c
         line:52 (   lp_loadparams(result, b, &*dm_disk_mod*);  )
          "*dm_disk_mod*" undeclared (first use in this function)

in fact i can not find the "*modules/modules.h*" in " disksim-4.0"

does anybody debug successfully using  *tool  codeblocks*?

thank you  for your help

Message-ID: <m2xe5f3edfc1005040208s7710497bjfe4fbe19ae415a35@mail.gmail.com>

dear dismsim-users:

i use gdb to learn out disksim.
the parameter file is synthraid5.parv ..
in isynthraid5.parv
"disksim_logorg org0 {
    Addressing mode = Array,
   Distribution scheme = Striped,
   Redundancy scheme = Parity_rotated,
"

i use gdb to debug this program with the  synthraid5.parv
(gdb --args ./disksim synthraid5.prav synthraid5.outv ascii  0 1)
when i  reach the function disksim_logorg.c:logorg_maprequest which is
called by  disksim_iodriver.c:iodriver_request
696 int logorg_maprequest (logorg **logorgs, int numlogorgs, ioreq_event *curr)
{
..............
773  if (maptype == ASIS) {
    curr->next = curr;
}
   else if (maptype == IDEAL) {
      logorg_mapideal(logorgs[logorgno], curr);
   }
   else if (maptype == RANDOM) {
      logorg_maprandom(logorgs[logorgno], curr);
   }
   else if (maptype == STRIPED) {
      numreqs = logorg_mapstriped(logorgs[logorgno], curr);
   } else {
      fprintf(stderr, "Unknown maptype in use at logorg_maprequest -
%d\n", maptype);
      exit(1);
   }

   if (reduntype == NO_REDUN) {
   }
   else if (reduntype == SHADOWED) {
      numreqs = logorg_shadowed(logorgs[logorgno], curr, numreqs);
   }
   else if (reduntype == PARITY_DISK) {
      numreqs = logorg_parity_disk(logorgs[logorgno], curr, numreqs);
   }
   else if (reduntype == PARITY_ROTATED) {
      numreqs = logorg_parity_rotate(logorgs[logorgno], curr, numreqs);
   }
   else if (reduntype == PARITY_TABLE) {
      numreqs = logorg_parity_table(logorgs[logorgno], curr, numreqs);
   }
   else {
      fprintf(stderr, "Unknown reduntype in use at logorg_maprequest -
%d\n", reduntype);
      exit(1);
   }


my question is that :
the variable( "   reduntype == PARITY_TABLE ")in debugging is not
equal to  that ("disksim_logorg org0 { Redundancy scheme =
Parity_rotated")in synthraid5.parv

thank you for your help

Hi,

I am facing the following error , no matter how I change the bus or
controller configurations for my ssd disks in the Microsoft-SSD-extension
for disksim:

disksim: disksim_bus.c:508: bus_deliver_event: Assertion `(slotno >= 0) &&
(slotno < currbus->numslots)' failed.
Aborted

Has anyone faced such an error before ? What might I be possibly doing wrong
?
It would be great if someone helps.

Thanks a lot,
Arka.

hi, all
  I am a newer for disksim, now I want to know how to use the files *;outv
(such as atlas10k.outv) to produce the graphs?
 also I read the sentence 'then call grapher to plot the results' in
disksim-4.0/doc/Outline.txt, whether I should use the ' grapher ' and *.outv
to plot the results?

any suggests will be appreciated!

Hi Sneha,

Please subscribe to the disksim-users mailing list, if you not have done 
so yet.

Are you using Ubuntu for 32 bit or 64 bit? Can you be more specific 
where you are having problems?

This directory contains release 4.0 of the DiskSim storage subsystem
simulator.  Check out the doc directory for he corresponding reference
manual that describes the simulator and how to use it.

See the file COPYING for the copyright notice and copying conditions.

To quickly verify that you've got everything and that it works:

  1. "make" the top-level directory.
   
  2. "cd" to the subdirectory called "valid".

  3. type "runvalid".  This will execute the simulator a number of 
times, using
     sample configurations and workloads.  Among them are example validation
     experiments for a number of different SCSI disk drives.  To
     verify that things are working correctly, compare the result
     values from each execution to the expected value (provided on the
     preceding line), which is rounded.

If you plan to use disksim as a stand-alone simulator, these examples and
the user manual should get you started.

If you plan to incorporate disksim into a larger-scale simulator (e.g., a
full system simulator), disksim_interface.c should be very helpful in
getting it to happen quickly and relatively painlessly.  It is not compiled
into disksim for standalone operation.  Thanks to Eran Gabber at Lucent,
there is now a simple example of a system-level simulator incorporating
disksim as a slave -- check out syssim* (before and after compilation).

Please send bug reports, experiences, and problems to disksim at ece.cmu.edu.
If you find disksim useful, please let us know about it!

There are two public mailing lists for disksim:
disksim-announce at ece.cmu.edu
disksim-users at ece.cmu.edu

disksim-announce only receives official announcements about bugfixes
and new versions of DiskSim.  disksim-users is for public discussion.

Please visit one of these sites to join the mailing lists:

Subject: [Disksim-users] A problem in using the Cachemem module
Message-ID: <2889FE30-C028-49A9-BAC6-043CE7A7F28E@gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using the Cachemem module in the DiskSim 4.0 currently. The simulations run very well and obtain some reasonable results under most traces. However, for some traces, with a larger cache size, the "IOdriver Response time average" will also increase. It looks counter-intuitive. In my test, I used the simpledisk module as the storage device, and configured a cachemem module at the controller layer, atop the simpledisk. The traces I used is the MSR Cambridge traces, which can be downloaded from the URL: http://iotta.snia.org/traces/list/Subtrace?parent=MSR+Cambridge+Traces. To support the MSR traces, I modified the original DiskSim-4.0 source code to support this type of traces, and made requests' addresses and lengths aligned to 4KB. Because the traces are very IO-intensive, I changed the MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH value from 10000 to 100000 in the disksim_logorg.c. When I ran the simulation with the different cache sizes (2MB, 4MB, 8MB, 16MB, 32MB, 64MB, 128MB) under the src2_2.csv trace, the results as follows:
2MB_simpledisk_src2_2.outv:IOdriver Response time average:      32.755975
4MB_simpledisk_src2_2.outv:IOdriver Response time average:      30.813907
8MB_simpledisk_src2_2.outv:IOdriver Response time average:      31.827948
16MB_simpledisk_src2_2.outv:IOdriver Response time average:     38.167345
32MB_simpledisk_src2_2.outv:IOdriver Response time average:     60.471973
64MB_simpledisk_src2_2.outv:IOdriver Response time average:     100.896662
128MB_simpledisk_src2_2.outv:IOdriver Response time average:    157.491571

I am wondering whether there is something wrong with my configuration file or anything else. Any help or clue is highly appreciated.

Subject: [Disksim-users] DiskSim Compilation Problem
Message-ID: <AANLkTinRxw1-qZa=Ld8LMrmNGJa9d7v8hQzA-N1AQqP6@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to setup/configure DiskSim 3.0. I am trying to use this older
version b/c it is compatible with an SSD Simulator previously integrated
with DiskSim 3.0. I downloaded the file straight from the DiskSim website (
http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/DiskSim/disksim3.0.shtml). I get several errors when
trying to run make at the upper level directory as the readme specifies. I
have tried this on OS X 10.6.4, Solaris 10, and also on Red Hat Linux.

I did find this comment of a user experiencing the same problem:
https://sos.ece.cmu.edu/pipermail/disksim/2006-December/004223.html

The user said they made several modifications to get it to "make" properly
but did not list exactly what the mods were. Could you please tell me what
modifications need to be done so that this code will compile?

Thanks!
Jonathan

Here is my output from running make.

I run 3.0 on Fedora Core release 2 (Tettnang), gcc 3.3.3

After download 3.0 from CMU, edit line 319 in libparam/mod.pl

from
fprintf(stderr, \"*** error: in $MODNAME spec -- missing required
parameter \\\"%s\\\"\n\", $aname"."[c].name);

to
fprintf(stderr, \"*** error: in $MODNAME spec -- missing required
parameter \\\"%s\\\"\", $aname"."[c].name);

It works for me. Hope it works for you too.

I can't find any direction from the log. What is the version of your gcc ?
Did you try older versions ? I mean < 4.0

Fellow DiskSim Users,

First, let me say thank you to all of you who have been helping me get
DiskSim 3.0 compiled. After a several days going at it, I finally got
DiskSim 3.0 running! I used info from your emails and several different
guides that I was referred to.

After finally getting it working, I decided to gather all of the information
I used and place them all into one guide. Here it is. I hope this helps
future DiskSim users.

Thanks again for all your help!
Jonathan

Subject: [Disksim-users] IODriver Response time - With FlashSim integration
Message-ID: <AANLkTimAjYDy-CA52Qm2S6hRFDCbYvkLYjXEG1VoG92q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have integrated the Object-Oriented FlashSim simulator from PSU with
DiskSim along with FTL and GC modules (http://csl.cse.psu.edu/?q=node/321)
and I am able to run the Financial 2 trace as well. However, I am not able
to find out where to plug-in the read/write delays etc. for the SSD. The
values that I want to plug-in can be seen in the attached file. The SSD is
created by creating an object of the Ssd class and all I/O requests go to
this class. The event_arrive() function returns the time taken to process
the event. How do I integrate this time with the IODriver response time of
the DiskSim simulator? Should the return value of event_arrive() be
integrated with the IODriver response time or should I plug-in these delays
to the DiskSim at a different place?

It would be great if any of you can give me some information on these
things.

Thanks,
Chaithra

Hi Jonathan,

your continuos support is very appreciated.
Would you kindly try to send again Compiling_FlashSim doc again but in pdf format? I never got it before.
I am having some issue while trying to open with word ( some conversion error).

Thank you!

Francesco.

  Francesco,

  I had this same issue whenever I would do a 'make clean'. I am fortunate b/c the only files I really need to modify are dftl.c, fast.c, and pagemap.c. My workaround isn't the most elegant solution, but it works. In the Compiling FlashSim guide that I sent you previously, right before I do step 7 (which is the 'make' step), I create a snapshot of my Ubuntu VM. After the snapshot is complete, I can easily revert back to the snapshot, make any changes to my c code and then run 'make' again. Another way you can do it is to just create a copy of your 'src' directory prior to running a 'make' on it ('cp -p src src.orig'). And whenever you want to modify the code and recompile,  you need to just delete the src directory and copy the original one back in place ('rm -r src; cp -p src.orig src').

  One of the problems for the 'make clean' is that it deletes the files. When it tries to regenerate them again with the 'make', it puts several of the fprintf statements across multiple lines, which for some reason do not compile in the gcc version that we are running (I'm assuming it is the gcc version that is the culprit...remember, this version of disksim 3.0/flashsim is tightly coupled to gcc 3.3.6). So when I originally got disksim working, I had to manually grep for fprintf in the src directory (`grep fprintf ~/src`) and find all of the files that had fprintf statements that spanned multiple lines and then go modify all of these to be on a single line. I probably had to do this for 15-20 fprintf statements in various files throughout the code. So if you look at my steps in the Compiling Flash Sim guide, I have already modified all of these fprintf statements for you in the attached .gz file. Once you extract this src directory according to the instructions, this is what your src.orig should be based off of.

  Again, this isn't the most graceful solution but this worked for me.

  Also, please include the disksim users email list in your replies to me so that everyone can benefit from our discussion as I know many others are having the same issues. Thanks!

  To the other DiskSim users out there, if anyone knows the webadmin to this page: http://csl.cse.psu.edu/?q=node/322 could you please have them email me? I would like to post my FlashSim instructions and the updated tar file (both attached) on there for others to use so they can easily get FlashSim running.

  Thanks!
  Jonathan

      Can you be more specific? Which parameters in particular do I need to modify?

      Basically, the only thing that I did was the following:
      1) Divided the request size (bytes) by 512 because my sectors are 512Bytes. So now the size is in sectors. To my understanding, this is what DiskSim requires.

      2) I changed the device number to always be 0 (since I am only simulating one SSD)

      3) I moved the parameters around from SPC format to disksim format as follows:
      <arrival time> <devicenum> <LBA> <size in # of sectors> <1 or 0 for read or write>


      Are there other modifications that I need to do besides that?

      Thanks,
      Jonathan

        Hi,
             If you want to use the IO trace file directly that download from the website (for example,Financial 1), you must filter the trace file to fit your disk parameter. It is a hard question that I have tried do it nearly , but not successful. 
             Thanks!

        Alex,

        I've moved your responses up to the top so the rest of the forum won't get confused trying to distinguish the your responses from my questions.

        I've also CCed Aayush Gupta and Youngjae Kim as they were the authors of the DFTL paper that my environment is based on. Hopefully, they can shed some light on what I'm doing wrong.

        On your response to Error #1 (Segmentation fault)...

        When I run it for the Financial1 trace file using all 3 FTLs, I get the following output to screen:

        Running Pagemap FTL...
        start_blk_no: 1107318608, block_cnt: 4, total_util_sect_num: 2097152
        Running DFTL...
        ./runtest: line 11:  5905 Segmentation fault      ../src/disksim dftl.parv dftl.outv ascii ./trace/test.file 0
        Running FAST...
        start_blk_no: 1107318608, block_cnt: 4, total_util_sect_num: 2097152

        As stated earlier, if I check the .outv files that were generated for each of these FTLs, none of the simulations ever completed.

        I have not run it using gdb. The code is compiled already. I suppose I could try to do so, but I would think that I should be able to run it as is.

        I have also attached the exact script that I run when I simulate the 3 FTLs. Again, this is the same exact environment that the DFTL authors used.

        On your response to Error #2 (simulation stopped due to saturation), when running runtest script against the Financial2 trace file, I get this output to the screen.

        Running Pagemap FTL...
        Stopping simulation because of saturation: simtime 108.435867, totalreqs 10394

        IOdriver Response time std.dev.:        15.487314
        Running DFTL...

        IOdriver Response time std.dev.:        19.068197

        IOdriver Response time std.dev.:        8.028486


        As far as slowing down the request-ratio...well, I could be misunderstanding what you are saying, but I thought that the way it works is that the real world requests come in exactly as the arrival times state in the trace file. Then if the hard drive(s) is(are) busy, then they just go in the request queue waiting to be serviced. I could understand that for a synthetically generated trace, it might be worth slowing down the request ratio just to see what happens, but this is a real world trace. So if I slowed down the request-ratio, this would mean modifying the arrival times, which would invalidate the trace as it would no longer be real world.

        Thanks,
        Jonathan

        On Error #1 (Segmentation fault), could give us some more information?
        Have you tried to run it with gdb und typed "bt"?
         
        On Error #2 (Simulation stopped due to saturation), maybe your harddisk model is too slow to serve the requests within a appropriate amount of time so the requestqueue doesn't get saturated. In a real system you've got a operating system which keeps track of this issue. Linux for example, slows down every readahead and writeback activity to reduce the number of requests if it detects congestion conditions. It has a requestqueue which is on top of the driver holding every request.
        Have you tried to slow down the request-ratio?

            DiskSim users,

            First, let me apologize for making this email so long. I wanted it to be thorough so my problem is explained clearly.

            I'm running DiskSim 3.0 with FlashSim (same as the FlashSim in the DFTL paper). It's basically DiskSim 3.0 with support for SSD.

            I've been running the "runtest" script which basically runs a small sample test file through all 3 FTLs: Page mapped, DFTL, and FAST. The test trace that was included is very small (8-9MB) and I get the intended results as the authors of the DFTL paper did. 

            All the runtest script does is run the same trace file on these 3 FTLs:
            ../src/disksim pagemap.parv pagemap.outv ascii ./trace/test.file 0
            ../src/disksim dftl.parv dftl.outv ascii ./trace/test.file 0
            ../src/disksim fast.parv fast.outv ascii ./trace/test.file 0


            Upon successful completion of the simulation, I noticed that in the .outv files, I will see:
            <<
            ...
            loadparams complete
            Initialization complete
            Simulation complete
            ...
            >>

            After this, I will see many performance statistics along with every request. I get the appropriate results when simulating DFTL, FAST, and pure page mapped FTL.

            However, once I tried putting any other real world trace (which is much longer) in the simulation, it does not complete successfully. It should be noted that I have not made any modifications to any of the 3 FTLs during these tests. I have verified that my format of the trace files is correct:
            <arrival time> <devicenum> <LBA> <size in # of sectors> <1 or 0 for read or write>

            There are 3 different results that I get, all of which are unsuccessful simulations:
            1) Segmentation fault
            2) Simulation is stopped because of saturation 
            3) Simulation seems like it finished, but when you check the .outv files, the last line says "initialization complete" (in otherwords it does not ever say "simulation complete"

            One example (Error #1) is when I run the entire finanical trace in, I get a segmentation fault simulating DFTL. Although I didn't get segmentation faults for FAST or pure page mapped, their corresponding .outv files do not look correct. They seem like they never finished simulating. In the .outv files for all 3 FTLs, it shows:

            <<
            ...
            loadparams complete
            Initialization complete
            >>

            But it never shows "simulation complete" and thus the results are not shown in the .outv file. The weird thing is that if I just include maybe several hundred lines of the Financial1 trace instead of the entire thing, it completes successfully with no problem, so I know my format of the file is correct.

            Another example (Error #2) I noticed that I the Financial2 trace did not have any segmentation faults but instead I had a different message:
            <<
            Stopping simulation because of saturation: simtime 108.435867, totalreqs 10394
            >>

            I did some research and found that there is a define statement in disksim_logorg.c that sets the MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH to be 10000. In each of the instances when the simulation stopped due to saturation, the totalreqs number was just over 10000. I imagine the queue length is getting very large due to the fact that I only have a device num of 0 since my GC algorithm will be a local GC algorithm, not a inter-disk algorithm.

            And lastly, if (Error #1) or (Error #2) occur, the simulation will never complete and no simulation summary will be in the .outv file (which is Error #3).

            My questions are as follows:
            Regarding (Error #1), I have no idea why I am getting segmentation faults. Do you think it is some type of buffer overflow issue b/c there is so much data with the real world traces? Remember, that if I just take a smaller subset of the real world data, it simulates to completion without any problem.

            Regarding (Error #2), I can try just increasing the MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH to maybe 100000 and see what happens, but is that the right solution or is there something else that I need to be aware of.

            Regarding (Error #3), I would assume that this will be solved once I find the solutions to (Error #1) and (Error #2).

            I really appreciate any help or hints you can offer. I will also post this to the disksims mailing list.

            Thanks for your valuable time,
            Jonathan Tjioe

No problem. Glad to help. The word file was in .docx format. I think you
need Office 2007 or newer for it. Or you would have had to download/install
the free office compatibility pack. But attached is the pdf.

Here you go.

Francesco,

I had this same issue whenever I would do a 'make clean'. I am fortunate b/c
the only files I really need to modify are dftl.c, fast.c, and pagemap.c. My
workaround isn't the most elegant solution, but it works. In the Compiling
FlashSim guide that I sent you previously, right before I do step 7 (which
is the 'make' step), I create a snapshot of my Ubuntu VM. After the snapshot
is complete, I can easily revert back to the snapshot, make any changes to
my c code and then run 'make' again. Another way you can do it is to just
create a copy of your 'src' directory prior to running a 'make' on it ('cp
-p src src.orig'). And whenever you want to modify the code and recompile,
you need to just delete the src directory and copy the original one back in
place ('rm -r src; cp -p src.orig src').

One of the problems for the 'make clean' is that it deletes the files. When
it tries to regenerate them again with the 'make', it puts several of the
fprintf statements across multiple lines, which for some reason do not
compile in the gcc version that we are running (I'm assuming it is the gcc
version that is the culprit...remember, this version of disksim 3.0/flashsim
is tightly coupled to gcc 3.3.6). So when I originally got disksim working,
I had to manually grep for fprintf in the src directory (`grep fprintf
~/src`) and find all of the files that had fprintf statements that spanned
multiple lines and then go modify all of these to be on a single line. I
probably had to do this for 15-20 fprintf statements in various files
throughout the code. So if you look at my steps in the Compiling Flash Sim
guide, I have already modified all of these fprintf statements for you in
the attached .gz file. Once you extract this src directory according to the
instructions, this is what your src.orig should be based off of.

Again, this isn't the most graceful solution but this worked for me.

Also, please include the disksim users email list in your replies to me so
that everyone can benefit from our discussion as I know many others are
having the same issues. Thanks!

To the other DiskSim users out there, if anyone knows the webadmin to this
page: http://csl.cse.psu.edu/?q=node/322 could you please have them email
me? I would like to post my FlashSim instructions and the updated tar file
(both attached) on there for others to use so they can easily get FlashSim
running.

Thanks!
Jonathan

Hi,all 
      Did someone know how the latency of RAM infulence the disk's transfer rate?
      I add the cache function into the disksim, but find that the running time is so huge because of the reading of the RAM information is too slow. But by the increasing the running time, the response time of disk is not increase. That means the reponse time of disk is not conrresponding to the simulation time.
      Can anyone give an explanation? Thank you!
      Best regards!

Here's what I would say:-
StaticAssert is a macro defined in disksim_global.h.
#define StaticAssert(c) switch (c) case 0: case (c):

The point is to detect a problem before the code is run, although the 
error message that is generated is confusing. Since sizeof(ioreq_event) 
and DISKSIM_EVENT_SIZE are known at compile time, I would assume the 
preprocessor does the evaluation and inserts the result in the place of 
the comparison.

Let's say the result is 0, ie the condition asserted to be true is in 
fact false.

Then this code will turn into:-
switch (0) case 0: case (0):

And gcc will complain.

The source reason for this failure is you are trying to compile disksim 
on a 64 bit system. disksim is not 64-bit clean, so compile this in 
32-bit mode by changing the gcc invocation to have the -m32 flag.

Hope this helps,
Michael.

Subject: [Disksim-users] The Disk's " Rotation speed (in rpms)" parameter
	value in the source code!
Message-ID: <CAK1HXHpJxm1RVaRMoHi1bLu8waFzX1e9JEF4n4ORZEX_2nvPqg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I have a question regarding the source code of the disksim. I'd be grateful
if anybody has any hint or comment about it.

 For my current research simulation, i'm in need of dynamically changing the
rotation speed of some disks during the simulation for power-saving
purposes. In other words, the value of rotation speed parameter of the disk
mechanical model should be changed after a particular elapsed time. For this
goal, i have to figure out where this parameter value of each disk is stored
in the code and how this parameter is loaded and used for rotational latency
calculation.
I found out that the main information is in the disksim_diskctlr.c (mainly
in the lines 4105-4111) for calculating the rotational latency of each
request. However, i have not figured out yet where exactly the rpm value of
each disk is stored in order to manipulate it. Has anybody else done
something similar to this? any clue?

Thanks

Best,
Peyman

Hi,

The struct you are looking for is called dm_mech_g1 in 
diskmodel/mech_g1.h. It stores the rpm and the rpmerror. If you look at 
when rpm is used you will find it in mech_g1_load.c (dm_mech_g1_load 
function). It is used to calculate the rotatetime variable of 
dm_mech_g1. This variable is used in various places in mech_g1.c e.g. 
dm_rottime_g1.

To me it seems that instead of changing the rpm you should rather 
change the rotatetime, since the rpm is only used during load to 
compute the rotatetime... You should be able to access the structure

Hope this helps,

Hello all,
                       I'm pretty new to Disksim. Recently I met some problems.I followed what DIXtrac says to extract the local disk model. when doing the disk layout mapping,it shows :
... ...
Executed 2 address translations, for 0 LBNs (0.00x speedup)
write(sg_io) result = 0xffffffff cmd = 0x37
read(sg_io) status = 0xffffffff
Sense buffer:
 ------- Internal error -------
Cannot handle defect list format (0)
dx_layout: dxtools.c:127: internal_error: Assertion `internal_error == 0' failed.
make: *** [layout.mappings] Aborted
make: *** Deleting file `layout.mappings'
 
The problem has confused me for a couple of weeks. If anyone have used DIXtrac, could you please help me? I will really appreciate it. Thank you very much!

Message-ID: <CAHH=T0dFNgF9Kx9QY51tc3o-jwj30nExXwCw8jh8FyjaT5V3EQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

my name is Sergey Gordok and I'm a student (M.Sc.) in the Technical
University Darmstadt (Germany).

Right now working with the research group on new algorithms for
Database Management Systems on SSDs (Flash disks).
I would like to use  DiskSim to perform tests (e.g. new
algorithms for FTL layer of SSD).
I have not yet installed the software, but have found on some forums
that some versions (e.g. v.1.0, 3.0) are not capable for x64
hardware).
Is the last version on the official site (i.e. v4.0) 64-bit capable (hardware
or software).

I'm working on x64 processor Inter Core i3 2.13 GHz*2.
OS right now is -  ubuntu 11 x64. (but this is not a problem to
install x86 ubuntu)

I have also found in the paper "The Structural Simulation Toolkit" that
"... First, we modified DiskSim to be 64-bit compliant to support
current hard-ware architectures.
After significant testing and validation,we submitted these changes
back to the original developersfor general distribution."

If the version v4.0 is not x64-hardware capable, have you such? Can
you give it to me?

Thanks a lot!

Best,
Sergey

Hi,

The following patch did the trick for me:

    
http://scobyseo.blogspot.com/2009/12/disksim-40-ssd-extention-64bit-patch.html

The only inconvenience is that the patch did not apply cleanly, but it 
worked when I applied it manually.

Hope this helps,
-Peter

Message-ID: <CAHH=T0fZkfgqU-S6-f2anSpTViStpavoZMDcSbZGi7py1+mgAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

thanks for the replies on the patch for the x64.

Have one more question:

will the DiskSim 4.0 compile under ubuntu 11 (gcc, g++ 4.6) or should
I compile under gcc 3.3.6?

Is there somewhere instructions about this?

Thanks

Best,
Sergey

Yes , I do compile it with gcc 4.6. Post your log if you face to any
problem.

Subject: [Disksim-users] System Level Simulation
Message-ID: <CA+7+aCfePWHtqd78bhp3PYQh0fr63CxXQ0fBaUtr5c8ZV4AiwA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am doing a simulation using disksim as a blackbox (using Disksim in
system level simulation as suggested in page 44 of the manual). Here is the
situation:

I am using the same trace and .parv files to do an interface simulation and
an internal simulation. Both of them are giving different results. When I
observed the output event files I found that the event sequence is a lot
different in both the scenarios and I have no idea why it is happening so.
My doubt is can this happen, given that I am using the same input?

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Message-ID: <CAHH=T0cJ_afrBiM9q6YOO0kPLfkKC6-kTbC51YP+uNQ+OzFKNA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to compile the DiskSim 4.0 and have the following error:

"...memsmodel/mems_piecewise_seek.c:524: undefined reference to `sqrt'"

and so on... (see the log file)

It seems to be a problem with the mathlib link, however I've check in
the makefile, and there is all ok (i.g. gcc -lm ...).

I'm actually not very familar with C/C++ and linux systems, so I'm in trouble :)

Can anyone help me?

My system is:

ubuntu 11.10 x64
DiskSim 4.0. (with x64 patch)
gcc, g++ 4.6
flex, bison 2.5
IDE Anjuta


Thanks a lot!

Best
Sergey

Hi,

thanks for reply.

Unfortunately the update doesn't help.

Have you another idea? :)

Message-ID: <CACpOm--UC+_t5B=iNzbGJ2E1scuABsj5J6ctKBbP7CTKaGEoYQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all!

I am new to DiskSim, and I have not fully understood how to use it yet.

Basically, I need to make a C program which will call DiskSim.

As far as I understand things, in the parameter file I can "build" the
topology of my system, I can specify which disks I'm going to be using, the
type of disk, etc.

What I don't understand is how to tell the simulator what to do. Let's say
I want to simulate the writing of a 100MB file... how can I pass such a
request?
Should it be in the tracefile, or would it be "synthetically generated?
What would the "tracetype" be?

As you can see, I'm really lost here, and the PDF from the CMU web page is
more of a reference than a manual.

So... can someone help me out with this? Or maybe someone knows where I can
find an actual tutorial/manual on how to use DiskSim?

Greetings!

Rick

Hi,

There is a very simple, yet complete, example that is directly distributed as a part of the DiskSim source code - it's src/syssim_driver.c. It shows you how you can run DiskSim from your C code and pass to it your own requests one I/O request at the time.

In short, you need to specify a .parv file (such as any one of those in the valid/ directory) and an output file when you initialize DiskSim using disksim_interface_initialize(), and then you can submit your own I/O requests using disksim_interface_request_arrive() as shown in the example. The only catch is that you would need to make additional calls to disksim_interface_internal_event(), but that's all shown in the example.

To run the example, just compile DiskSim as usual, and then you can run something like "src/syssim valid/hp_c2490a.parv output.txt 10000" from the disksim/ directory.

I hope this helps.

Best,

-Peter

Hi,

I have seen the behavior before and studied the execution of the syssim.
you will see differences at the level of the disksim_diskctlr. These
differences come from an issue within the current syssim implementation in
which the following happens:
1) a request is inserted into disksim
2) the request is handled
3) the method to report completion is called

Until now everything seems fine, if the next request would immediately
start after the request completion method is called. Unfortunately this is
not the case, the syssim stays within the loop processing disksim events.
/* Process events until this I/O is completed */
while(next_event >= 0) {
 now = next_event;
 next_event = -1;
 disksim_interface_internal_event(disksim, now, 0);
}

Why is this the case? The request is fully processed so there shouldn't be
any events within the system, right?
Disksim adds an event automatically after every request to continue
reading after the request is over. This is done at the disksim_diskctlr
level and continues until the segment storing the request is full.

For me this meant a difference in completion time and next starting time
of around 0.5ms.

To address the issue I think I added && completion == 0 to the while loop.
This should stop the loop when the request is completed. All other events
will not be taken into account then. You may run into trouble, if you
insert multiple requests starting nearly at the same time.

I hope this helps...

Anjo

Peter & Anjo,

Thanks for the reply guys. This is exactly what i am doing (suing
syssim_driver.c). The example gives a way of creating some random requests,
instead of that I have created the request from a trace file (the same
trace file which i used on the "storage level disksim simulation"). I am
using the same parameters for both the simulations, but getting different
results.

I didn't understand the complete post by Anjo. However, his clue on the way
system level simulation is going on makes me think that the example in the
syssim_driver.c is modeled more or less like a closed system (a request is
added using the  disksim_interface_request_arrive() and then is allowed to
process completely using  disksim_interface_internal_event() without adding
any new requests to the queue).

And I think this is what is explained here
https://sos.ece.cmu.edu/pipermail/disksim-users/2007-September/000214.html

Please let me know if this makes any sense and in the mean time i will try
to change the syssim_driver and see if i can make any progress. I once
again thank you guys for your time.

Hi,

Yes, this makes sense. The problem with the syssim_driver.c example is that all requests are processed synchronously, and there is only one outstanding request at the time.

You can interleave calls to disksim_interface_request_arrive() and disksim_interface_internal_event() in such way so that there are multiple outstanding requests at any time. Just make sure that the timestamps in your calls to these two functions are monotonically increasing. Going back to the syssim_driver example, if you want to run a second I/O request at time t while the first one is still running, wait until you get (now <= t) && (t < next_event) in the "while(next_event >= 0)" loop and then make the call to disksim_interface_request_arrive() using t as a timestamp. (If the first request finishes before the time t, start it as usual.)

I hope this makes sense...

-Peter

The example gives a way of creating some random requests, instead of that I have created the request from a trace file (the same trace file which i used on the "storage level disksim simulation"). I am using the same parameters for both the simulations, but getting different results.

However, his clue on the way system level simulation is going on makes me think that the example in the syssim_driver.c is modeled more or less like a closed system (a request is added using the  disksim_interface_request_arrive() and then is allowed to process completely using  disksim_interface_internal_event() without adding any new requests to the queue).

Message-ID: <20111214034501.E850240B04F@mail1.webapp.51uc.com>

Hi, all!
     I am new to Disksim,  and want used disksim to execute an FTL arithmetic. I used ubuntu-10.10 as the platform, and compliled Disksim-3.0 successful. 
     According the message  of Peter, we can run the example like "src/syssim valid/hp_c2490a.parv output.txt 10000" from the disksim/ directory.  But when syssim has 4 parameter, then I run the example  "src/syssim valid/hp_c2490a.parv output.txt 10000 1", and an error appeared.

the Error Message is as below:
root at kuangwei-virtual-machine:/home/disksim-3.0# src/syssim valid/dec_rz26.parv output 10000 1*** error: couldn't open dec_rz26.diskspecs
> *** assertion failed: in disksim_global_loadparams() (modules/disksim_global_param.c:90): statdeffile != 0: failed to open statdefs file!

Another question is how to printf log in Disksim-3.0. I can not used "printf" function and other file operation function does not work, please give me an example.
 
Thanks

Guys,

First of all let me thank Peter :). This is what I ended up with to make
the system level simulation work in an asynchronous way (so that some one
can use it as a reference).

while(fgets(line, 200, tracefile))
{

    sscanf(line, "%lf %d %d %d %d \n", &r.start, &r.devno, &r.blkno,
&r.bytecount, &r.flags);
    printf("%lf %d %d %d \n", r.start, r.devno, r.blkno, r.bytecount/512);
    fflush(stdout);
    nextiotime = r.start;

    while((nextiotime >= next_event) & (start == 1))    // used start as a
flag to mark it as a first time entry to the loop.
    {
        currtime = next_event;
        disksim_interface_internal_event(disksimIntr, currtime, 0);
    }
    {
        start = 1;
        currtime = nextiotime;
        disksim_interface_request_arrive(disksimIntr, currtime, &r);
    }

Guys,

Now I am facing another problem. In the file disksim_interface.c it is
written that the function disksim_interface_io_done_notify () can be used
as a call back for request completion.

/* This is the disksim callback for reporting completion of a disk
 * request to the system-level simulation -- the system-level *
 * simulation should incorporate this completion as appropriate *
 * (probably by inserting a simulated "disk completion interrupt" at *
 * the specified simulated time).  Based on the requestdesc pointed to
 * * by "curr->buf" (below), the system-level simulation should be
 * able * to determine which request completed.  (A ptr to the
 * system-level * simulator's request structure is a reasonable use of
 * "curr->buf".)

According to this paragraph it says that curr->buf can be used at the
system level driver for calculating statistics. However, buff->start is not
indicating the start time of the request that got completed and is
indicating the start time of the recent request scheduled (It perfectly
works for synchronous requests as the example shows, but for asynchronous
requests its giving out -ve response times). Am I missing something here,
any advice on the situation is highly appreciated.

Subject: [Disksim-users] questions about adding prefetching method to disksim
Message-ID: <7CC53E28-4EE0-4438-903E-9AC55355A283@gmail.com>

Dear all, 

 I am going to add my own prefetching method to disksim. After debugging the disksim code, I think I should add this scheme to the "cache_read_continue" function which is implemented  in  the "disksim_cachemem.c" file. I don't know if I am right or not. I also think I must define a "prefetching request" as an event. and treat it like a "I/O request" event. I have some questions. I hope you have time to help me about them.

1. Would you please tell me what is the difference between "extraq" and "intq"?
2. It seems "extraq" is like a stack which holds all events. If I want to send a new I/O request , I don't know if it is a good idea to add the request to this stack. Because the new request should wait till the prior read disk has been completed.

Thanks and best regards,
Samaneh

	Workload!
Message-ID: <AANLkTinRjenazPxnoVGAyudCdDMR02rK_UVYOWV1sziw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

This is Peyman Behzadnia, a PhD student in Computer Science & Engineering.
I'm contacting you guys regarding the 'Saturation Error' of the disksim.

I've run a simulation on top of the disksim4 in which i have to feed the
simulator with my ascii-format workload with high intensity (100-700
requests per second). The problem is that the disksim has constantly given
the saturation error: the simulation stopped due to saturation. I have
re-checked all of the detailed parameters in my parameter file and also have
tested my workload with the sample parameter files provided by the disksim.
But, it gives the same error. When i decrease the intensity into 1 request
per 1-2seconds, it works well.
I personally do not believe that such disk simulator can not even handle 20
requests per second. It might be something about a configuration. I
appreciate if somebody can give me a hint or comment about how to fix this
saturation error.

Best,
Peyman

The saturation error happens because the workload is heavier than the
simualted storage system can handle... not because the simulator itself
can't keep up.

Good luck,

No, I'm sorry, but I can't know that.  Look at the throughput you see
with less intense worklaods to project what it is capable of doing.

As Prof. Ganger said your workload is very heavy. In other words, the trace
file issue IO request very fast, i.e faster than a real system.  You may
double check the unit (s, ms) of the time in your traces. Also you can scale
requests time with in a parameter in disksim parv file. Please refer to
disksim manual for this time scaling parameter.

Hi,

At the best of my knowledge there exists only a reference manual. Within 
the $DISKSIM/doc folder exists an Outline.txt which gives a basic 
understanding of the disksim code. I would not call it a developer's manual.

Hope that this one might help.

Subject: [Disksim-users] How to change the 'Trace Time Scale' Parameter in
	the 'iosim' Block!
Message-ID: <AANLkTimWSDj-XaBn5jNrCr+Wcwk1eMmgVDQmWxGsDRBQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have a heavy workload trace(100 req/sec) which i want to feed it into my
simulation. I need to scale it through the ' Trace Time Scale' parameter
such that the simulation can handle it without saturation error. The
confusing thing here is that, when i simply change this parameter value in
my parameter file, it does not reflect any change in the output file, even
any change in any number. I tried to manually change this paramater value
through the simulator's code though, but again no effect. Also, i could not
modify it through 'parameter override' in the command. Has anybody touched
this parameter before somehow?
I appreciate your hints or comments about this issue.

Thanks
Peyman

Hi,

I looked into the same issue. Abdullah it might be to late for you, but 
I think there is a hack which makes multiple disks and a single ssd 
possible. It is not a generic solution and might require to adopt defines!

It would be great, if anyone of you could look into the generated diff 
(difftomakeahybriddisk.txt) and verify that I'm not doing something 
completely wrong. The basic idea is to hard code the issue with the 
difference indexing of devices (devno...). In addition a problem with 
the logorg came up which can also be hard coded, because we know which 
logorg should be used.

For the enclosed parv I could run synthetic traces for the disk as well 
as the flash.

Thanks,
Anjo

Subject: [Disksim-users] How to change the 'Trace Time Scale' Parameter

Hi Peyman,

The reason why 'Trace Time Sacle' does not work when you change the number in the configuration file, perhaps is that the function of "disksim_iosim_loadparams" is not called to load the iosim parameters. However, if you manually change the value of this parameter in disksim_iosim.c, it should work. I did it and it works. 

By the way, there is another way to achieve the same goal with an *ugly* minor change to the Disksim source code. Because other parameters could be loaded from a configuration file, you can use other parameter that is in other sections instead of iosim and you do not use in your test (e.g., 'Time stamp interval' in logorg if you do not configure your storage system as a parity-encoded RAID system). Then, you insert one line of code in disksim.c, something like this:

disksim->iosim->ioscale = disksim -> iodriver_info -> logorgs[0] -> stampinterval;

after calling the disksim_loadparams() but ahead of calling the prime_simulation() in the disksim_setup_disksim() function.

I think it is worth trying for you.

Lei

Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP246CEBBDFBC16A0CB71BF9C7D70@phx.gbl>

Hi,

I am trying to use the Seagate Cheetah 15k.5 disk (files can be
downloaded at http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/DiskSim/diskspecs.shtml) with
Disksim 3.0 (my Disksim modifications were made on 3.0 and have not
yet been ported to 4.0).

The Cheetah disk files are in the G4 disk layout model format, which
is not supported by Disksim 3.0. Is there any way to convert the disk
files from G4 disk layout model format to the G1 disk layout model
format, which is supported by Disksim 3.0?

Or, where can I find disk model files for disks (year 2006 or after)
in a disk layout model format accepted by Disksim 3.0?

Thank you very much.

Regards,
Yipkei

Subject: [Disksim-users] System Level Vs Controller Level RAID
Message-ID: <AANLkTikb1W-qB+2gbj77HE5qigsnL2GuYD2yfTU5Jc1F@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

In the section 3.8(Disk Array Data Organizations) of the disksim-4.0 manual
it is given that:

Although DiskSim is organized to allow organizations both at the
system-level
(i.e., at front end of the device drivers) and at the controller-level, only
system-level organizations are supported in the ?rst released version.

Is this still valid in the Current release of Disksim( i.e. ver4). Will I be
able to simulate a RAID5 array on DIsksim at the controller level. And can
someone please explain the difference between the two Organizations apart
from their topology.

Yes, still true.  The difference is just topology -- can only do a logical
organization at the driver level of the topology.

Dr Ganger,

Thanks for the prompt reply. So, synthraid5.parv will be a good start
in-order to work on RAID5 right??

Dr Ganger,

I have one more question. In the outline.txt file it is mentioned
"Graphall and grapher will use the information in par.graph and the plots
dir to generate a few graphs"

but I couldn't locate any file named "graphall". This question has already
been asked and it got no responses.

Hi Purushotham,

I checked our code repository, and the only mention of graphall is in in 
the outline.txt file. But there is a directory doc.src.v3 that looks 
like it has a makefile that creates graphs for several drives. Perhaps 
that is what you may want to look at?

Greetings,
Michael.

Hi All,

 

I am just approaching DiskSim for the first time.

Is there available any step by step tutorial to set up DiskSim compilation with visual studio 2008?

 

Thank you a lot & Regards

Dr. Stroucken,

Thanks for the reply. I couldn't find the exact file/folder which you are
referring to neither in disksim4/disksim3 source code nor in the  CMU
repository. Could you post a direct link where I can download the source.

Hi Puroshotham,

Thanks, but I'm not a "Dr."

I guess that directory is part of our internal sources, and was used to 
generate the document in the "doc" directory. It isn't more than taking 
output and writing a gnuplot script to take the data and generate an eps 
file.

Greetings,
Michael.

Hi,

I am not sure how to use DiskSim on VS, but I have been using it on
CodeBlocks. If all you need is an IDE with debug capabilities, then you can
give codeblocks a try. Here is the link on how to use Disksim with
codeblocks.

Specifications for Western Digital disk WD5000AAKB-00YSA0 is what I

okay. (The largest SCSI disk in Emulab machines is only 125GB).

Subject: [Disksim-users] problem differentiating disk states
	(active/idle/sleep)
Message-ID: <CAE1RpTwKO6F=XovEhu1XnEM+MuEn62zg6YfCHuyosmpvu-9hig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm working on power consumption by the disks in different states which have
been mentioned to be active, idle and sleep. totally I've got some problem
determining which struct to access in order to recognize disk state. Also
I've difficulties with the determination of
figure-out-transfers-between-states algorithm. Would someone mind helping
me??

sincerely

Hi,

The problem you're describing is caused by the 64bit OS you're using. 
You will find in the mailing list archive several threads about 64bit 
compiling problems and how they are solved. (e.g. changing to a 32bit 
machine, using -m32 flag for gcc, ...)

Hope this helps...

Anjo

Oh, right, you can get a 64bit disksim patch here:

I really should have announced this earlier.

It should work.  If it doesn't, please tell me, as I wrote it.

Hello, 
?
List newbie, so this may be a repeat question. 
?
Anyone familiar with using DiskSim on SSD? (NAND). 
?
I know there's an MS-provided package for SSD support. 
?
I am asking whether anyone has successfuly analysed SSD usage, layout, etc using DiskSim. 
?
Thanks in Advance,

Hello:

I'm trying to use  the Hpl trace cello99. I have compiled the DataSeries and Lintel software followed the instructions at http://tesla.hpl.hp.com, I find the cello99 trace format is srt, but I can't install SRTlite software in my os. I want to know if I can use DataSeries to convert the trace  without installing SRTlite, and how to do it? I want to analysis cello99 trace according the experiments in DFTL paper, and I alseo don't know how to do this, I'm running a Fedora core 14, If anyone has an idea... 
Thank you very much for your help.

Hello, everyone!

I want to measure the storage system's peak throughput under a certain

IOmeter and IOzone do to a actual storage

 How can I accomplish this with DiskSim?

Greeting All

I would like to  simulate the SSD model using a real system generated I/O
trace ... The problem is that Disksim/SSD Only accept LBA as multiple of 8s,
the same for I/O request size !!!!.

Any advise to get around this issue without jeopardizing the accuracy of the
real trace ????

Subject: [Disksim-users] Max Addressable LBA in SSD Trace File
Message-ID: <BANLkTimFHWuRELmYDH8ceL-4SboOMMpvNg@mail.gmail.com>

Greeting All

Does Any one know how to Calculate the MAX Addressable LBA that can be used
in SSD Trace File given the PARV file below. ( 64 GB SSD)

My Understanding is that the MAX LBA is calculated as follows

2048 Blocks * 8 Planes * 64 Pages * 8 Elements = 8388608 Pages in the SSD

Abd Since each Page in SSD is 8 KB, Then it can hold 16 LBA of size 512
Bytes

So the MAX addressable LBA is 8388608 * 16 = 134217728

HOWEVER, When I use this LBA in my SSD Trace File, I get an ERROR

unexpected request location: devno 0, blkno 134217728, bcount 8

Assertion failed:
simtime     = 5297.450000
totalreqs     = 3
disksim: disksim_logorg.c:763: logorg_maprequest: Assertion `logorgno != -1'

Subject: [Disksim-users] SOLVED Max Addressable LBA in SSD Trace File
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=KxdNp_h71FXs=RBjg5fYjhz6fzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Thanks for your clarification ... based on my current parameters in parv
file

Pages Per Block         = 64
Blocks Per Plane        = 2048
Planes Per Element    = 8
Page Size                  = 8 sectors = 4 KB
So ... Pages Per Single Element = 1 (Element) * 8 (planes) * 2048 (Blocks) *
64 (Pages) = 1048576 Pages

Each Page is 8 Sectors ---> which means the MAX Addressable Sector = 1048576
* 8 = 8388608 - 1 = 0 .. 8388607 Sectors

NOW the Important issue the the MAX VALID (Address, Req Size) Combination
which is as follows ...

5265.313 0 8388599 8  0    ( 8388607 - 8 = 8388599) is the MAX Valid I/O
Trace (Address, Req Size) Combination -- TESTED with disksim successfully


5265.313 0 8388600 8  0   will generate ERROR with disksim cause it exceeds
the MAX (Address, Req Size)
unexpected request location: devno 0, blkno 8388600, bcount 8

Assertion failed:
simtime     = 5265.313000
totalreqs     = 1
disksim: disksim_logorg.c:763: logorg_maprequest: Assertion `logorgno != -1'
failed.



The same concept is applicable if we change the Req size to 16

5265.313 0 8388591 16  0   work Successfully

5265.313 0 8388592 16  0   Error !! ..
unexpected request location: devno 0, blkno 8388592, bcount 16

Assertion failed:
simtime     = 5265.313000
totalreqs     = 1
disksim: disksim_logorg.c:763: logorg_maprequest: Assertion `logorgno != -1'
failed.

Final observation
The MAX VALID (Address, Req Size)  will increase with an additional element
added in the parv file

Hello,
       Everyone, I want to modify the read and write time of the simpledisk module. Does anybody know what can I do if I do change the access time of simpledisk module's behavior.
       So I can set the read time and write time of the simpledisk!
       Waitting for the reply!
       Thanks!

      Hello, Everyone who use the Disksim simulation tool. May I ask a simple question about disksim?
      If you have the logical sector address from the IO request, then how you can get the physical sector address from the disksim? Does disksim have the function that show the physical sector address of the Hard Disk.
      Waiting for the reply!

I think you're wrong. The disksim receives a physical sector address and
a request size. With these information he computes a duration for this
request.
What you mean is to translate a logical address to a physical address. A
filesystem has to cover this action.
A filesystems task is to map a logical address belonging to a file into
a physical sektor address.

Correct.  The simulator includes support for doing the same sort of mappings
that disk drives do (or "did", since some of the newer stuff isn't in there).

Subject: [Disksim-users] how to add address translation at the controller
Message-ID: <AANLkTikvhhuWx3gyvnp0EnzHL=GpC7kvk1FEif4h4jBs@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all

I would like to study a storage system comprising of SSDs and HDD's in
different RAID combinations. ( similar to autoraid, DHIS )
I would like to use an address translation layer at the controller, which
decides the location of blocks during
reads / writes based on factors such as the queue length , throughput,
current disk head position.

The problem is that when using disksim , the location of blocks ( for read /
write ) should be known before
running the simulation. Is there anyway using which i can provide this
information online.


Thanks,
sanoj

     Hello,everyone. If I want use one disk to cache another disk, but the cache disk is too small that the IO request logical address is out of the capacity of the cache disk. So the disksim assert error, because the request logorg is -1, and the logical address request is out of range.
    Does anyone account for this problem. If do, please reply me.
    Thanks!

Subject: [Disksim-users] DiskSim 3.0/FlashSim Simulation problems
Message-ID: <AANLkTinL=EwtdsFQ0_xaFquuf02J7mZGzYHf6JG2kASJ@mail.gmail.com>

DiskSim users,

First, let me apologize for making this email so long. I wanted it to be
thorough so my problem is explained clearly.

I'm running DiskSim 3.0 with FlashSim (same as the FlashSim in the DFTL
paper). It's basically DiskSim 3.0 with support for SSD.

I've been running the "runtest" script which basically runs a small sample
test file through all 3 FTLs: Page mapped, DFTL, and FAST. The test trace
that was included is very small (8-9MB) and I get the intended results as
the authors of the DFTL paper did.

All the runtest script does is run the same trace file on these 3 FTLs:
../src/disksim pagemap.parv pagemap.outv ascii ./trace/test.file 0
../src/disksim dftl.parv dftl.outv ascii ./trace/test.file 0
../src/disksim fast.parv fast.outv ascii ./trace/test.file 0


Upon successful completion of the simulation, I noticed that in the .outv
files, I will see:
<<
...
loadparams complete
Initialization complete
Simulation complete
...
>>

After this, I will see many performance statistics along with every request.
I get the appropriate results when simulating DFTL, FAST, and pure page
mapped FTL.

However, once I tried putting any other real world trace (which is much
longer) in the simulation, it does not complete successfully. It should be
noted that I have not made any modifications to any of the 3 FTLs during
these tests. I have verified that my format of the trace files is correct:
<arrival time> <devicenum> <LBA> <size in # of sectors> <1 or 0 for read or
write>

There are 3 different results that I get, all of which are unsuccessful
simulations:
1) Segmentation fault
2) Simulation is stopped because of saturation
3) Simulation seems like it finished, but when you check the .outv files,
the last line says "initialization complete" (in otherwords it does not ever
say "simulation complete"

One example (Error #1) is when I run the entire finanical trace in, I get a
segmentation fault simulating DFTL. Although I didn't get segmentation
faults for FAST or pure page mapped, their corresponding .outv files do not
look correct. They seem like they never finished simulating. In the .outv
files for all 3 FTLs, it shows:

<<
...
loadparams complete
Initialization complete
>>

But it never shows "simulation complete" and thus the results are not shown
in the .outv file. The weird thing is that if I just include maybe several
hundred lines of the Financial1 trace instead of the entire thing, it
completes successfully with no problem, so I know my format of the file is
correct.

Another example (Error #2) I noticed that I the Financial2 trace did not
have any segmentation faults but instead I had a different message:
<<
Stopping simulation because of saturation: simtime 108.435867, totalreqs
10394
>>

I did some research and found that there is a define statement in
disksim_logorg.c that sets the MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH to be 10000. In each of the
instances when the simulation stopped due to saturation, the totalreqs
number was just over 10000. I imagine the queue length is getting very large
due to the fact that I only have a device num of 0 since my GC algorithm
will be a local GC algorithm, not a inter-disk algorithm.

And lastly, if (Error #1) or (Error #2) occur, the simulation will never
complete and no simulation summary will be in the .outv file (which is Error
#3).

My questions are as follows:
Regarding (Error #1), I have no idea why I am getting segmentation faults.
Do you think it is some type of buffer overflow issue b/c there is so much
data with the real world traces? Remember, that if I just take a smaller
subset of the real world data, it simulates to completion without any
problem.

Regarding (Error #2), I can try just increasing the MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH to
maybe 100000 and see what happens, but is that the right solution or is
there something else that I need to be aware of.

Regarding (Error #3), I would assume that this will be solved once I find
the solutions to (Error #1) and (Error #2).

I really appreciate any help or hints you can offer. I will also post this
to the disksims mailing list.

Thanks for your valuable time,
Jonathan Tjioe

Could give us some more information?
Have you tried to run it with gdb und typed "bt"?
> 2) Simulation is stopped because of saturation
Maybe your harddisk model is too slow to serve the requests within a 
appropriate amount of time so the requestqueue doesn't get saturated.
In a real system you've got a operating system which keeps track of this 
issue. Linux for example, slows down every readahead and writeback 
activity to reduce the number of requests if it detects congestion 
conditions. It has a requestqueue which is on top of the driver holding 
every request.
Have you tried to slow down the request-ratio?

about  Error #1 (segment fault), check if logic address range of your trace
is out of that your device can take.

Alex,

I've moved your responses up to the top so the rest of the forum won't get
confused trying to distinguish the your responses from my questions.

I've also CCed Aayush Gupta and Youngjae Kim as they were the authors of the
DFTL paper that my environment is based on. Hopefully, they can shed some
light on what I'm doing wrong.

On your response to Error #1 (Segmentation fault)...

When I run it for the Financial1 trace file using all 3 FTLs, I get the
following output to screen:

Running Pagemap FTL...
start_blk_no: 1107318608, block_cnt: 4, total_util_sect_num: 2097152
Running DFTL...
./runtest: line 11:  5905 Segmentation fault      ../src/disksim dftl.parv
dftl.outv ascii ./trace/test.file 0
Running FAST...
start_blk_no: 1107318608, block_cnt: 4, total_util_sect_num: 2097152

As stated earlier, if I check the .outv files that were generated for each
of these FTLs, none of the simulations ever completed.

I have not run it using gdb. The code is compiled already. I suppose I could
try to do so, but I would think that I should be able to run it as is.

I have also attached the exact script that I run when I simulate the 3 FTLs.
Again, this is the same exact environment that the DFTL authors used.

On your response to Error #2 (simulation stopped due to saturation), when
running runtest script against the Financial2 trace file, I get this output
to the screen.

Running Pagemap FTL...
Stopping simulation because of saturation: simtime 108.435867, totalreqs
10394
IOdriver Response time average:         17.003924
IOdriver Response time std.dev.:        15.487314
Running DFTL...
Stopping simulation because of saturation: simtime 107.151359, totalreqs
10255
IOdriver Response time average:         25.488591
IOdriver Response time std.dev.:        19.068197
Running FAST...
Stopping simulation because of saturation: simtime 106.554985, totalreqs
10188
IOdriver Response time average:         10.128997
IOdriver Response time std.dev.:        8.028486


As far as slowing down the request-ratio...well, I could be misunderstanding
what you are saying, but I thought that the way it works is that the real
world requests come in exactly as the arrival times state in the trace file.
Then if the hard drive(s) is(are) busy, then they just go in the request
queue waiting to be serviced. I could understand that for a synthetically
generated trace, it might be worth slowing down the request ratio just to
see what happens, but this is a real world trace. So if I slowed down the
request-ratio, this would mean modifying the arrival times, which would
invalidate the trace as it would no longer be real world.

Thanks,
Jonathan

Hi!

Have you tried to run it with gdb und typed "bt"?

On Error #2 (Simulation stopped due to saturation), maybe your harddisk
model is too slow to serve the requests within a appropriate amount of time
so the requestqueue doesn't get saturated. In a real system you've got a
operating system which keeps track of this issue. Linux for example, slows
down every readahead and writeback activity to reduce the number of requests
if it detects congestion conditions. It has a requestqueue which is on top
of the driver holding every request.
Have you tried to slow down the request-ratio?

Francesco,

I'm glad my previous procedures were helpful to you. That's why I wrote them
=)

I understand what you are saying about changing the subsystem. For example,
I am simulating only 1 SSD. The original Financial traces are simulating
multiple hard disks. I have modified the trace so that for devicenum, it is
always 0 (hard disk 0). I believe this is a valid modification to the trace
since it doesn't not change the request arrival times, size of each request,
etc. It is only changing the physical disks I have available to run the
simulation through. However, I'm not sure that changing the arrival times is
a legitimate change. For example, the Financial traces are very write
intensive - the time between writes is very small, i.e. the write request
rate is very high. If I changed these arrival times to be further spaced
apart, I cannot legitimately say that I ran my GC algorithm or FTL through
the Financial trace as now it is not as write intensive as it should be.
However, changing things about my subsystem: how many disks I have, what
kind of disks they are, etc. are completely valid changes. Hopefully that
clears up what I was trying to say.

With that said, I'm not sure if I understand exactly what you meant by this:
<<
Regarding this I am still in trouble since I read somewhere that it is
possible to configure simulator in order to make it behave as a closed
subsystem model also on external I/O traces making it ignore the 'arrival
times' have you an idea on how this can be done?
>>

I'm not sure how that can be done.

I read the link you sent me. I don't think I am implementing any magnetic
disks. Do you know where I can look in the code to check exactly which disks
are implemented? (I'm not that familiar with DiskSim yet).

Thanks,
Jonathan

Can you be more specific? Which parameters in particular do I need to
modify?

Basically, the only thing that I did was the following:
1) Divided the request size (bytes) by 512 because my sectors are 512Bytes.
So now the size is in sectors. To my understanding, this is what DiskSim
requires.

2) I changed the device number to always be 0 (since I am only simulating
one SSD)

3) I moved the parameters around from SPC format to disksim format as
follows:
<arrival time> <devicenum> <LBA> <size in # of sectors> <1 or 0 for read or
write>

Are there other modifications that I need to do besides that?

Thanks,
Jonathan

That's exactly why a trace should be submitted to your SSD so that a new request is scheduled only when the previous one has been completed (this is what I mean by closed subsystem model). In this way you are able to evaluate the performance of various FTL schemes given a same access sequence (trace)
In other words your original trace is intensive just because, being the requests dispatched in parallel over more than one SSD, the average execution time is smaller causing next access arrival time to be nearer to the previous.

Does anyone know hot to configure the simulator so that even with an external trace a new request is scheduled only when the previous one has been executed (making simulator ignore the 'arrival times') ?

Regarding disksim I am just trying to run a debugging session with code block to get more familiar with the code but I am not so familiar with Linux, makefile. I am having trouble when giving 'make clean' and 'make'.
It seems that 'clean' command changes also all the .c files causing the original compilation error :(.

What IDE are you using?

  Francesco,

  I'm glad my previous procedures were helpful to you. That's why I wrote them =)

  I understand what you are saying about changing the subsystem. For example, I am simulating only 1 SSD. The original Financial traces are simulating multiple hard disks. I have modified the trace so that for devicenum, it is always 0 (hard disk 0). I believe this is a valid modification to the trace since it doesn't not change the request arrival times, size of each request, etc. It is only changing the physical disks I have available to run the simulation through. However, I'm not sure that changing the arrival times is a legitimate change. For example, the Financial traces are very write intensive - the time between writes is very small, i.e. the write request rate is very high. If I changed these arrival times to be further spaced apart, I cannot legitimately say that I ran my GC algorithm or FTL through the Financial trace as now it is not as write intensive as it should be. However, changing things about my subsystem: how many disks I have, what kind of disks they are, etc. are completely valid changes. Hopefully that clears up what I was trying to say.

  With that said, I'm not sure if I understand exactly what you meant by this:
  <<
  Regarding this I am still in trouble since I read somewhere that it is possible to configure simulator in order to make it behave as a closed subsystem model also on external I/O traces making it ignore the 'arrival times' have you an idea on how this can be done?
  >>

  I'm not sure how that can be done.

  I read the link you sent me. I don't think I am implementing any magnetic disks. Do you know where I can look in the code to check exactly which disks are implemented? (I'm not that familiar with DiskSim yet).

  Thanks,
  Jonathan

    Hi Jonatan,

    I just find out that I am following your same steps with FlashSim encouneing problem that you've already solved :)...
    Regarding your statement:

    "So if I slowed down the request-ratio, this would mean modifying the arrival times, which would invalidate the trace as it would no longer be real world"

    I have to respectfully disagree since a "trace" gives you the performance of a very specific system configuration. Changing one or more subsystem may have still sense in order to see how the new configuration will perform given the same request sequence.

    Regarding this I am still in trouble since I read somewhere that it is possible to configure simulator in order to make it behave as a closed subsystem model also on external I/O traces making it ignore the 'arrival times' have you an idea on how this can be done?


    Regarding segmentation fault I found this, but I guess you have already given a glance:

      Alex,

      I've moved your responses up to the top so the rest of the forum won't get confused trying to distinguish the your responses from my questions.

      I've also CCed Aayush Gupta and Youngjae Kim as they were the authors of the DFTL paper that my environment is based on. Hopefully, they can shed some light on what I'm doing wrong.

      On your response to Error #1 (Segmentation fault)...

      When I run it for the Financial1 trace file using all 3 FTLs, I get the following output to screen:

      Running Pagemap FTL...
      start_blk_no: 1107318608, block_cnt: 4, total_util_sect_num: 2097152
      Running DFTL...
      ./runtest: line 11:  5905 Segmentation fault      ../src/disksim dftl.parv dftl.outv ascii ./trace/test.file 0
      Running FAST...
      start_blk_no: 1107318608, block_cnt: 4, total_util_sect_num: 2097152

      As stated earlier, if I check the .outv files that were generated for each of these FTLs, none of the simulations ever completed.

      I have not run it using gdb. The code is compiled already. I suppose I could try to do so, but I would think that I should be able to run it as is.

      I have also attached the exact script that I run when I simulate the 3 FTLs. Again, this is the same exact environment that the DFTL authors used.

      On your response to Error #2 (simulation stopped due to saturation), when running runtest script against the Financial2 trace file, I get this output to the screen.

      Running Pagemap FTL...
      Stopping simulation because of saturation: simtime 108.435867, totalreqs 10394

      IOdriver Response time average:         10.128997
      IOdriver Response time std.dev.:        8.028486


      As far as slowing down the request-ratio...well, I could be misunderstanding what you are saying, but I thought that the way it works is that the real world requests come in exactly as the arrival times state in the trace file. Then if the hard drive(s) is(are) busy, then they just go in the request queue waiting to be serviced. I could understand that for a synthetically generated trace, it might be worth slowing down the request ratio just to see what happens, but this is a real world trace. So if I slowed down the request-ratio, this would mean modifying the arrival times, which would invalidate the trace as it would no longer be real world.

      Thanks,
      Jonathan

      Have you tried to run it with gdb und typed "bt"?
       
      On Error #2 (Simulation stopped due to saturation), maybe your harddisk model is too slow to serve the requests within a appropriate amount of time so the requestqueue doesn't get saturated. In a real system you've got a operating system which keeps track of this issue. Linux for example, slows down every readahead and writeback activity to reduce the number of requests if it detects congestion conditions. It has a requestqueue which is on top of the driver holding every request.
      Have you tried to slow down the request-ratio?

          DiskSim users,

          First, let me apologize for making this email so long. I wanted it to be thorough so my problem is explained clearly.

          I'm running DiskSim 3.0 with FlashSim (same as the FlashSim in the DFTL paper). It's basically DiskSim 3.0 with support for SSD.

          I've been running the "runtest" script which basically runs a small sample test file through all 3 FTLs: Page mapped, DFTL, and FAST. The test trace that was included is very small (8-9MB) and I get the intended results as the authors of the DFTL paper did. 

          All the runtest script does is run the same trace file on these 3 FTLs:
          ../src/disksim pagemap.parv pagemap.outv ascii ./trace/test.file 0
          ../src/disksim dftl.parv dftl.outv ascii ./trace/test.file 0
          ../src/disksim fast.parv fast.outv ascii ./trace/test.file 0


          Upon successful completion of the simulation, I noticed that in the .outv files, I will see:
          <<
          ...
          loadparams complete
          Initialization complete
          Simulation complete
          ...
          >>

          After this, I will see many performance statistics along with every request. I get the appropriate results when simulating DFTL, FAST, and pure page mapped FTL.

          However, once I tried putting any other real world trace (which is much longer) in the simulation, it does not complete successfully. It should be noted that I have not made any modifications to any of the 3 FTLs during these tests. I have verified that my format of the trace files is correct:
          <arrival time> <devicenum> <LBA> <size in # of sectors> <1 or 0 for read or write>

          There are 3 different results that I get, all of which are unsuccessful simulations:
          1) Segmentation fault
          2) Simulation is stopped because of saturation 
          3) Simulation seems like it finished, but when you check the .outv files, the last line says "initialization complete" (in otherwords it does not ever say "simulation complete"

          One example (Error #1) is when I run the entire finanical trace in, I get a segmentation fault simulating DFTL. Although I didn't get segmentation faults for FAST or pure page mapped, their corresponding .outv files do not look correct. They seem like they never finished simulating. In the .outv files for all 3 FTLs, it shows:

          <<
          ...
          loadparams complete
          Initialization complete
          >>

          But it never shows "simulation complete" and thus the results are not shown in the .outv file. The weird thing is that if I just include maybe several hundred lines of the Financial1 trace instead of the entire thing, it completes successfully with no problem, so I know my format of the file is correct.

          Another example (Error #2) I noticed that I the Financial2 trace did not have any segmentation faults but instead I had a different message:
          <<
          Stopping simulation because of saturation: simtime 108.435867, totalreqs 10394
          >>

          I did some research and found that there is a define statement in disksim_logorg.c that sets the MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH to be 10000. In each of the instances when the simulation stopped due to saturation, the totalreqs number was just over 10000. I imagine the queue length is getting very large due to the fact that I only have a device num of 0 since my GC algorithm will be a local GC algorithm, not a inter-disk algorithm.

          And lastly, if (Error #1) or (Error #2) occur, the simulation will never complete and no simulation summary will be in the .outv file (which is Error #3).

          My questions are as follows:
          Regarding (Error #1), I have no idea why I am getting segmentation faults. Do you think it is some type of buffer overflow issue b/c there is so much data with the real world traces? Remember, that if I just take a smaller subset of the real world data, it simulates to completion without any problem.

          Regarding (Error #2), I can try just increasing the MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH to maybe 100000 and see what happens, but is that the right solution or is there something else that I need to be aware of.

          Regarding (Error #3), I would assume that this will be solved once I find the solutions to (Error #1) and (Error #2).

          I really appreciate any help or hints you can offer. I will also post this to the disksims mailing list.

          Thanks for your valuable time,
          Jonathan Tjioe

Hi All,

Has anyone already implemented on FlashSim or SSD sim a method  to track the NAND block P/E cycles so that it is possible to have a blocks wear levelling figure/statistic at the end of a specific trace?

Subject: [Disksim-users] several questions about ioqueue
Message-ID: <AANLkTikeHtBYY2z7QWuuYhGy-j0J5h7J-b1dfpBGRFb_@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

There is a long member list in ioqueue structure, and I cannot find
any explanation on these members in length. Would you like help me to
clarify them?

What are the meanings and relationship of:
iobufcnt  ~ reqoutstanding
listlen ~ numoutstanding
numcomplete

I plugged SSD module into the Disksim.  I use synthio to generate the
random write events to SSD module. I met a problem.

1. when the synthio found the synthion_cnt is equal to the set value,
then stop the disksim
2. However, there still have some requests not be handled by the SSD module.

3. If I disable disksim_stop() when synthio_cnt == max_cnt.
    Howevere, there is a long queue in ssd->queue->base.numoutstanding

How can I solve my problem?

Thanks a lot,
Yashan

Message-ID: <BANLkTinBw8g7vpLAykHFe1n2Aw_iJCNQMg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello DiskSim users,
I was trying to configure open synthetic workload, using one disk
Seagate_Cheetah15k disk. From the disksim 4.0 manual, it is said that
configuration can be done by setting the probability of  critical time to 0,
the probability of limited time to 0, and setting number of processor to be
equal to number of generators at 'system-level'.
I tried to set the probabilities to zero, however when I run, it gives me
'segmentation fault'.

But also I didn't understand 'system-level', where is the 'system-level'
that I should change, I assume its the parameter file, however after I
change that also its still gives me 'segmentation fault'


Shanice.

   neither planes and elements. it depend on your setting

   according to parameter file
   --------
     # how many parallel units are there?
     # entire elem = 1, two dies = 2, four plane-pairs = 4
     Number of parallel units = 8, "
 ----------------------------------------------------

       e.g.:
      "entire elem " means   that  all planes in package can not work
independently

Subject: [Disksim-users] RAID 5 Configurations for SSD in Disksim --help
Message-ID: <tencent_1343FAF756328F9C176E1450@qq.com>

hi,disksim users
     By reading the manual, I know disksim support RAID 5 for SSD.But either  in the ssd_iozone.parv or the ssd-sw5m.parv, there is only one ssd. We  know that if we want to  configure RAID 5,we need three or more SSDs.

     should I modify the topology? I tried,but failed. Can you help me? 
    I modified the ssd-sw5m.parv as follows:(only  list the modified part)
    ssdmodel_ssd SSD0 {
     ??
     }
    ssdmodel_ssd SSD1 {
      ??
      }
    ssdmodel_ssd SSD2 {
      ??
      }
    ssdmodel_ssd SSD3 {
      ??
      }
    instantiate [ ssd0x0 ] as  SSD0
    instantiate [ ssd0x1 ] as  SSD1
    instantiate [ ssd0x2 ] as  SSD2
    instantiate [ ssd0x3 ] as  SSD3

Subject: [Disksim-users] devno, blkno in ascii trace and diskno in log_org
Message-ID: <BANLkTimNgVU7RwdbGWmYEUcdj3OWbQGDgA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone.

I want to know about the relationship between the devno in ascii trace
(second colume) and the diskno in logical organization.
For example, assuming that there's only one log_org configured in the
parameter file, with several disks organized in "Parts".
How does the devno in the ascii trace entry map to the diskno in the
log_org?
Is the blkno dedicated for the device or disk with the devno?  I mean, do
disks with different devno have seperate block address space (blkno)?
Thanks, sincerely

Subject: [Disksim-users] How to Simulate RAID5 based on one ssd?
Message-ID: <tencent_76E3FCA02D807FE347A4DCD9@qq.com>

hi,disksim users
       If I want to simulate RAID5 based on one ssd,maybe I should modify the ssd.c  and the related codes,it is so terrible. Can I transfer the question to this case:
      A big ssd with 8 elements and its total capacity is 8G, if I want to simulate RAID5 based on this ssd.Simulating RAID5 based on one ssd is not supported in Disksim,but n ssd can do in Disksim.
       So,can I transfer the question to this :
       Simulating RAID5 based on 8 small ssds,and every ssd with only one element,the total capacity of 8 ssds is 8G,too.We should ensure the total capacity is the same.then I can use Disksim to simulate RAID5.
       In first case,we use parallel between elements.and the second case ,we use parallel between ssds(here ssds equal elements,because one ssd with only one element).
       Are the two parallels the same?   Are they equivalent?   Is it feasible?

Subject: [Disksim-users] RAID 5
Message-ID: <BANLkTinrjeTk3+my0qFzM2D-uiC9Sh7Agg@mail.gmail.com>

How well tested is RAID 5 in DiskSim?  I set up a test to look at the
average request time for writes, varying the write size and offset
into a stripe.  I'm getting strange results.  For unaligned writes,
the average time drops when the write size reaches one stripe, even
though it is really two partial stripes.  For aligned writes, the
average time doesn't drop until one stripe width plus one sector.

Message-ID: <9B5BCBFA06224F32AE5AD3FF48350CF5@numonyx.local>

Dear disksim Users,

I am trying for so long to configure disksim so that external workload traces are handled in a closed way ( :a new request is picked up from the trace list and launched only when previous command execution is finished).
So far I was only able to configure this way the synth worload generator but I am not able to apply this configuration to external traces.

I read in some documentation that it should be possible to configure also the 'closed' behavior for external trace but cannot find how.

Can someone help me?

Thank you a lot & Regards,

Francesco.

Subject: [Disksim-users] ssd-add-on questions
Message-ID: <1306169416.27548.0.camel@poohtimu-linux>

Hi all,
I have some question about using ssd-add-on.
I have made it work properly in default setting while
runvalid(/ssdmodel/runvalid)
but while I modified the parameter in ssd spec, "Plane block mapping"
and "Number of parallel units", there is something wrong.
when I set Plane block mapping = 1 and Number of parallel units = 2,
synthetic workload "rw5m" and real traces "iozone" will generate
segmentation fault.
moreover, Plane block mapping = 3 and Number of parallel units = 2 
          Plane block mapping = 1 and Number of parallel units = 4 
          Plane block mapping = 3 and Number of parallel units = 4 
these parameter has same result. 
    
All I did is modified this two parameter, I can't figure out why there
is a segmentation fault
Is there anything I missed?
Please help me, I will appreciate your help

Best Regards

hi~

maybe try to add a line in the function of " ssd_media_access_request_element
"
original:
tmp->blkno = tmp->blkno;

modified:
tmp->blkno = tmp->blkno;
tmp->opid = curr->opid;

good luck

Hi,

It really works!! Including Number of parallel units = 1,2,4
But original should be "tmp->blkno = blkno"; not "tmp->blkno = tmp->blkno;"
 Thanks anyway. :D
Now I have a new problem about saturation msg while Plane block mapping =
simple concatenation in postmark trace
I will try first, thank you very much.

Error is 'saturation'.
The reason is that I remove command queuing (queue len==1) so the time when next
 command arrive the previous one is still there while being finished.
The point is I would the simulator not issue the command basing upon the arrival
 time of each command (indicated into the external trace) but rather simply I wa
nt the simulator to issue next command in the list only when the previous is end
ed.

I need to evaluate the performances of the device in executing a specific comman
ds list with no queue in the system.

Dear disksim Users,<br>
<br>
I am trying for so long to configure disksim so that external workload traces ar
e handled in a closed way ( :a new request is picked up from the trace list and 
launched only when previous command execution is finished).<br>

So far I was only able to configure this way the synth worload generator but I a
m not able to apply this configuration to external traces.<br>
<br>
I read in some documentation that it should be possible to configure also the &#
39;closed&#39; behavior for external trace but cannot find how.<br>
<br>
Can someone help me?<br>
<br>
Thank you a lot &amp; Regards,<br>
<br>
Francesco.<br>

Message-ID: <CAFu9Dv2r=ceiOs+5kUiSWaE3s_jmyG=SXJXeyq164xudtWhvzw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to create a model for a new hard drive, but I can't figure
out the dm_layout_g4.IDX parameter.  The documentation is far too
short.  Does someone have a good explanation for how this works?  Even
better, is anyone aware of a tool to automatically extract this from a
disk and generate the parameters?  I've looked at DIXtrac, but it says
it doesn't work with serpentine drives.  It also can't deal with the
fact that the disk refuses to report how many cylinders or heads it
has.  I have output from DIG, but I don't know how to convert it for
DiskSim.

Thanks,
Adam Crume

I looked at the raid model fairly recently and came to the conclusion that
one is better off writing one's own.  Disksim is great for disks but the
RAID model is pretty broken.

Disksim can be used to simulate RAID,but you should add your algorithm code to Disksim and make Disksim.I think disksim+ssdmodel does not work well,some useful code should be added.

No, this was on a physical machine.  The problem turned out to be
because I was using /dev/sdb instead of /dev/sg2.

Hi,

I encountered the same error which was already mentioned here
(https://sos.ece.cmu.edu/pipermail/disksim-users/2009-June/000407.html)

Here is my exact situation. I am using Disksim as a "slave" and when I
change the request count from 1000 to 10000 in syssim_driver.c
(LineNo: 65) file its giving me this error.

Another question regarding the same would be; basing on what
constraint do we set the value of disksim->fpcheck in the file
disksim_diskctlr.c (Line No: 1924).

Please let me know if you people need any additional information and
any help in this regard is highly appreciated.

Dear All,

I am looking for some ascii traces for SSD, other than postmark and Iozone.
Real traces such as OSDB are preferred. A write intensive trace is desired
and the bigger is the better (between 200,000 to 500,000 line). Any help
would be appreciated.

You may change the formatting of blktrace traces to ascii. I think Ms.
Sameki has written  this trace converter.

Subject: [Disksim-users] Synthetic sequential read performance
Message-ID: <4E68C500.608@mpi-sws.org>

Dear DiskSim users

Currently I'm facing an issue for the clean disksim 4.0 distribution 
using the Seagate Cheetah model provided on the CMU website in which 
sequential reads take longer than local reads. I enclosed the used 
parameter file. (changed the controller to type 3, type 1 shows the same 
result)

I tried to locate the problem using a synthetic seq. read workload and 
it seems that the following happens:
1. read access (starts at blkno)
  - seek to cylinder
  - rotate until first read block
  - start reading and transfering
  - finish request
2. read access (starts at blkno + 8)
  - misses the block blkno + 8 (first block)
  - reads the following 7
  - make one full rotation to read blkno + 8
3. read access (starts at blkno + 16)
  - rotate to blkno + 16
  - read 8 blocks and finish request
4. read access (starts at blkno + 24)
  - misses block blkno + 24 (first block)
  - same behaviour as 2. read access

Basically every second access introduces a full rotation, because it 
misses the first block. Unfortunately it does not read during the 
rotation into a disk buffer segment such that subsequent accesses would 
return the result immediately.

The avg. response time per request is about 4ms which results in a 
throughput of about 1MB/s. Usually I would expect for a 15k rpm disk 
70-80MB/s.

Hopefully one of you has seen this before and may be able to tell me how 
I have to configure or change the disk model parameters. Any idea would 
be very helpful.

Thank you very much in advance.

Subject: [Disksim-users] running a trace without timestamps
Message-ID: <CAA822EbhdRbfYNfofSxXubZE3DsY=8yazFAOaSDpAJiN9VCxJw@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone know an easy way to run a given trace of operations (R/W,
offset, len) without having explicit timestamps? i.e. the requests
enter a queue of a fixed size and the device serves the queued
requests as quickly as possible.

I'm inclined to modify synthgen to read a trace, but I'm hoping
there's an easier way..

Thanks,
Andy

In general, Once Disksim is starting to handle the current request, it will prepare the next request in the trace. [see the getnextevent() function in disksim.c]

Therefore, you may try this way:

Assuming the fixed queue length is N, no matter what time the timestamps of the first N requests in the real trace are, you could change the timestamps of them with a very slight ascending order(e.g., 0.000001ms difference) in io_using_next_external_event(). In doing so, DiskSim will enqueue them into its IOdriver request queue and start to process them one by one. Once the threshold N is reached, the No. N+1 request must be given a very large timestamp (e.g., 1000000ms) to make sure this request won't be enqueued and scheduled by Disksim if any one of the last N requests is not done. When one request of the last N requests is completed, you can find the No.N+1 request [its event type is NULL_EVENT] and dequeue it from the intq queue, change its timestamp as simtime + 0.000001ms, and then enqueue it in the intq queue again. In doing so, the length of the request queue of yours is always N, and DiskSim will do the rest for you.

Just for your reference. Good Luck!

Hi,
 
Through the output file in the simulation, I found 'Overall I / O System Requests per second: 90.138218',
which is too small. How do I calculate the IOPS, throughput and average response time.And how do I define

Message-ID: <CAEhbbW=PbyQs0tEv6k-itns7v6nztdZRFRKb-9HZkSRe5Drq=A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, everyone

The diskspecs attached within Disksim4.0 seem to be out of date (very small
capacity and only for SCSI disks).
Is there anyone who has up-to-date HDD diskspec model (*.diskspec, *.model
and *.seek files)? For example, SATA disk with hundreds of GB capacity.
The dixtrac tool within DiskSim seems only work with SCSI and FC disks.

Thanks,

I have the same problem with you, such as for a large-capacity disk of 80G, dixtrac dose not work.

Subject: [Disksim-users] Problem about stopping simulation because of
	saturation
Message-ID: <52bb8d3b.21645.136a5e835cc.Coremail.cq25062030@126.com>

Hi all,

I'm a freshman  of using DiskSim. Recently, I try to implement a simply Garbage Collection algorithm based on the ssd model source code provide by Microsoft, I only modify a part of  the ssd_clean.c file, and make a little change about the initialization function. The source code of DiskSim is kept the same as before. And I use the same test case as  Microsoft provided, but when I try to run the new code, the DiskSim give an error message like: Stopping simulation because of saturation..... 

This problem occurs when run the ssd-rw5m and ssd-postmark  test case.

I try to reduce the size of the request by modifying the configuration file as the website

https://sos.ece.cmu.edu/pipermail/disksim-users/2010-July/000516.html, 

the number of  simulated  request grows, but the problem occurs again at last. Also I try to debug the program, I find that the requests keep arriving, but little operation about issuing them, I can't find the reason that leads to generate this problem.

Could anyone give me some advice to solve  this problem? 

Thanks a lot.

Best wishes,

Qian Cheng.

Hi,

This is most likely because of DiskSim's hardcoded limit on the number of requests that can be in flight at the same time. The maximum number is MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH declared in src/disksim_logorg.c, which is by default 10000.

The problem is that disksim replays the disk I/Os from the trace at the same speed regardless of the performance of the simulated device. For example, if the trace has an I/O every 1ms, then disksim will issue an I/O every 1ms, regardless of how long that I/O takes to complete - even if it is not yet complete. So if the trace issues requests faster than the device can process, the simulation will die because of saturation.

A quick solution for this problem would be to increase the simulation time between successive requests. Multiplying all timestamps by 2 or 3 should help.

A more general solution to the problem - but also by far the most time solution - would be to develop a new trace format, with the corresponding record and replay tools, in which disksim would know which I/Os need to complete before which I/Os can be issued, so that the timing of the requests in the trace would adjust dynamically depending on the device performance. I hoped to do it at some point, but I was just never able to find the time for it.

Best,

-Peter

Recently, I try to implement a simply Garbage Collection algorithm based on the ssd model source code provide by Microsoft, I only modify a part of  the ssd_clean.c file, and make a little change about the initialization function. The source code of DiskSim is kept the same as before. And I use the same test case as  Microsoft provided, but when I try to run the new code, the DiskSim give an error message like: Stopping simulation because of saturation.....

HI~zh-lian:
    In oder to install the flashsim you must install bison and flex beside
the correct gcc version, I have install disksim3.0+flashsim many time
without any problem.
    hope I can help you .

hi,all
 
       I'm simulating ssd-add-on in disksim and some question disturbed me.
 
       1?If I want to set the size of generated random write request,how to modify the parameter ? 
 
       2?What does  "Sizes=[exponential,0.0,8.0]" mean in disksim_synthgen in ssd-rw5m.parv?  Can you calculate the sum of request size based on this parv file?
 
        I am looking forward your reply.
        best regards!

Subject: [Disksim-users] Why the overall average response time, almost 20000,
	is so big?
Message-ID: <CAAb6sL22Kgeu-BqwOY-aztaS=VkWAH201Nu5qjcjYUjb_Vu=qQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, everybody,

I need you help:-)

When I set the "I/O Trace Time Scale" in disksim_iosim to 1, the simulator
shows a saturation error before.
But when I change "I/O Trace Time Scale" in disksim_iosim to 10, the error
disappeared.

I think that is because the "request arrival time" of the trace file is too
small, which results that the number of the arriving requests in one second
is more than ones that the simulator could deal with in one second. So I
change the "I/O Trace Time Scale" in disksim_iosim to 10.

Next, I run it again, but the weired result made me crazy. When I ran
disksim using my ascii trace file, the overall response time, almost 20000,
is too big to believable.

Do anybody could tell me the reason and how to solve this problem. Thank
you so much. I am so appreciated.


I set the "request arrival time" like the following style.

0.5
0.75
1
1.2000
1.4000
1.5000
1.7000
2.0
.....


Hopefully, it could give some hints to find out my problem. Thanks.

There are so many I/O requests waiting in the queue. I do not know the
details of your storage systems, such as how many disks, how these disks
are organized. I suggest you check your storage configuration.

I have noticed that the average time interval between two I/O requests is
too small.  The first column means the I/O arrive time (ms), you issued 33
I/Os in 8.8ms.  The average time interval between two I/O requests is only
0.27ms.  However, the disk I/O access time (access time = data transfer
time + rotation time + seek time) is far larger than 0.27ms.  There are too
many pending I/O requests in the waiting queue and so the average response
time is Incredibly large.

Hi,

As Yinliang said the queuing time should account for the high response 
times. You can lookup the avg. queue time in the output statistics. 
Also the avg. queue length is recorded. You may need to enable the 
statistics in your .parv file.

That's very helpful. I will change the trace and test them again.

Thanks for YueYingLiang and Anjo,

Your response gets me out of my problem.

Hi all, I met the same problem as
https://sos.ece.cmu.edu/pipermail/disksim-users/2011-December/000699.html.
But I didn't find any solutions. Can anyone help me?

"Hi all,

I'm trying to compile the DiskSim 4.0 and have the following error:

"...memsmodel/mems_piecewise_seek.c:524: undefined reference to `sqrt'"

and so on... (see the log file)

It seems to be a problem with the mathlib link, however I've check in
the makefile, and there is all ok (i.g. gcc -lm ...).

I'm actually not very familar with C/C++ and linux systems, so I'm in
trouble :)"

I met the same problem before. In my memory, the solution is simple: adjust the appearance  of the "-lm" parameter to be the last parameter. You can have a try.

2 things that you may want to check

1. sqrt() may require the math.h header. Does the C file include the header?
2. Is your libm.a in a non-standard location? If yes, you need to use
the gcc flag -L to indicate the location of the library

Good luck. Hope it helps.

 "adjust the appearance  of the "-lm" parameter to be the last parameter".
It works. Thank you for your help.

Hi Yipkei,

Thanks for your help. Perhaps that will help the last person who asked
about a libm issue.

Also, there's a couple disksim projects on github. Maybe there are fixes
there for everyone. :)

Greetings,
Michael.

Hi, I have successfully used the disksim-4.0 on my own laptop with ubuntu
linux OS. Then I move the archive to my server and when I make, I meet the

In addition, I use the disksim-4.0-with-dixtrac.tar.gz and ssd patch from
MSR.

Disksim is for 32 bit machines only. Maybe you can get it to work if you add -m32 to CFLAGS.

Long,

Michael is right. The original version works on 32-bit machines only.  There is another option. It is easy for you to find tutorials as well as corresponding patches from the web or the maillist, to help you compile DiskSim on 64-bit machines. In my memory, There are at least two or three tutorials available on the web.

Hi

As stated by some people already, the problem is that Disksim won't
complile natively on 64 bit architectures.
There is a thread in the mailing list from December of last year, where
Peter Macko posted a link to a blog that explains how to patch Disksim to
work on 64 bit. The patch consists on changing about 6 or 7 source codes,
you can apply it in about 15 minutes =)

Subject: [Disksim-users] How to change the ssd capacity in disksim with ssd
	extentions
Message-ID: <CAL+t72FMEV8NE03im63fJ5BO1Xtd0wGVV06TMDZaEo6hPAJmNg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all. I have asked a few questions before. Thanks for all that has
helped me.

Now, I am using the SSD extentions and want to change the capacity of every
ssd. I change the parameters of ssd in parv file such as "Pages per block"
and so on. But it does not work and disksim run abnormally. Has anyone ever
change the capacity of ssd disks before?

I tried DiskSim + MSR SSD add-on before. I changed the capacity and ran it successfully. What is your problem description? You cannot start and run the DiskSim? or Disksim unexpectedly terminated during a run? or something else?

Hi! I run disksim with ssd extention with RAID5. When timscale=1.0, the
trace "ssd-postmark-aligned2.trace" run in 30s. But when the timescale=0.1,
it run in 160s! According to the manual of disksim-4.0, timescale
associates with work loads. Why the trace run much longer when the
timescale is much smaller?

Subject: [Disksim-users] How to compile DiskSim 4.0 on 64bit OS
Message-ID: <2012090111425461519516@smail.hust.edu.cn>

Hello.
I am new to DiskSim, and want to try it on Ubuntu 64bit. But when I compile it, I just get some compile errors.
I find some solutions from internet, e.g., adding -m32 gcc flag.
However, after adding -m32 flag I still encounter other problems, e.g., missing header files due to all header files that I owned are of 64bit version.
Would simply coping header files of 32bit version to my /usr/include/ directory makes it work? Or is there a complete guide to help me compiling DiskSim in 64bit environment?
Thanks.

Dear Disksim users,I'm using Disksim with ssd-add-on.

Message-ID: <9703034e097fc53d2e3d3e8b7b8f8f54.squirrel@webmail.cs.utsa.edu>

Hi,
I'm an undergraduate student working on a web application project.

My project consist of creating a web application that will upload a
tracefile made with blktrace, and display Disksim's output on a report.

My problem is that I can't find a way to convert the trace file of
blktrace into a trace file that can be directly used by Disksim.

I already tried blkparse, but I can't find the appropriate set of
parameters that would give me the appropriate input for Disksim.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank You

Hi,

One way to do this is to find a sensible set of blkparse arguments and then add support for this format directly do disksim. For example, I used

    blkparse -i - -f "+%T.%9t %M:%m %S %n %d %e\\n" \
                        | egrep '^\+' | sed 's/^\+//' \
                        | awk '{ \
                                if ($4 != "0" && $6 == "0") { \
                                        if ($2 in devices) { d = devices[$2] } else { d = length(devices); devices[$2] = d } \
                                        printf "%0.3f %d %d %d %s\n", $1*1000, d, $3, $4, $5 \
                                } \
                        }' \
                        | sed 's/R/1/' | sed 's/W/0/'

to parse and preprocess the trace in my project. Then add the support for your format to disksim as follows:

  1. Create a format type constant in disksim/src/disksim_global.h (there is a section with constants under /* Trace Formats */)
  2. Add a case clause in iotrace_set_format() in disksim/src/disksim_iotrace.c similarly as for the other formats
  3. Write a custom parsing function in disksim/src/disksim_iotrace.c (you can find many examples in the file)

You might need to modify the blkparse arguments from what I wrote above, since your use case is sufficiently different from mine. It sounds like you will be adding the support for this format directly to disksim, while the parser in my case was in a separate project that communicated with disksim as in syssim_driver.c.

Don't worry, it is easier than it looks! Or maybe someone else will reply with a better solution :)

Best,
-Peter

Dear disksim users,

Im using disksim 4 and, try to test several cache replacement algorithm,
I set the cache size to 16 and only use a very small trace file:

100 0   1   1   1
200 0   2   1   1
300 0   3   1   1

1900 0   19   1   1
2000 0   20   1   1

to know what happed I add a print statement to the cache_replace function
in file disksim_cachemem.c.

However I found that only CACHE_REPLACE_SLRU works correctly
(it runs cache_replace 4 times),
other cache algorithm CACHE_REPLACE_FIFO stop after processing the line 17
(it only runs cache_replace function 1 time).

Is there anybody experiencing the same problem?

Hi?Abdul Arfan
I trace this code and the problem is?
cache->map[set].lru[0]?
that has not value in the fifo, lifo and random replacement policies. These policies are not implemented correctly.?
The value of "line" variable after this statement is 0 and then the "if (line)" condition does not satisfied. This happens because the lru[0] list does't filled correctly. You can trace these methhods:
cache_add_to_lrulist

cache_remove_from_lrulist

that modify?lru linked lists.

Subject: [Disksim-users] Requests stripped at I/O driver for RAID-0
Message-ID: <CAF75uxyYYWnz8uGJXJ4whm76=8GqeRjd+og9_-oCZzbYtecREw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

On real hardware, requests are supposed to be stripped in the RAID
controller for a RAID-0 configuration. However, it is not the case in
DiskSim 4.0. When a request arrives the I/O driver, iodriver_request()
calls logorg_maprequest() to divide the request into stripes. Then,
iodriver_request() calls handle_new_request() to schedule each stripe
to the corresponding I/O-driver queue. The number of I/O driver queues
equals the number of disks and each stripe is sent to the queue
corresponding to the disk that is going to service the stripe.

1. Is it a problem with my parameter file? I copied below the
parameters of the I/O driver, controller, topology, and logical
organization below. I am attaching the entire parameter file in this
email but I am not sure if the mailing list server allows attachments.

2. If it is not because of a mistake in my parameter file, is there
any reason when DiskSim is designed this way?

Please help. Thank you.

You understand it correctly.  You can thinking of it like a striping
device driver (as provided in most OSs), or you can also think of the
driver and the controller together as the controller (with 0 for the
appropriate delays, the behavior would be the same).

As for why there aren't logical organizations in the controllers...
was on the to-do list, but never at the top of it.

Best luck,

Greg

Subject: [Disksim-users] Disksim as Slave - Some Questions
Message-ID: <CACpOm-96KfEyxbofBAxHRH56t0cv3Avz0AkB2jyANTRwJgYzKw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all!

Thanks to Peter Macko's answer from my previous question I know where to
start to use Disksim as a slave from another code, and I have already
gone through syssim_driver.c many times, so I think I already have somewhat
of a picture of how it works.

However, I still have some questions about some situations which are not
considered in syssim_driver.c, or which I at least have not yet understood:

1) I don't fully understand the disksim_request structure, so some of its
fields raise some questions:

    a) Device number (devno). Is this used as a reference of which disk
receives the request, in case there is more than one disk? If so... which
device number
        makes reference to which disk?  In the .parv files in ./valid, the
only one that I've found that has more than one disk instantiated is
ascii.parv (18 disks), and the
        mapping is done using disksim_iomap {}... but I cannot match the
tracedev and simdev parameters to the device number.
    b) Block number: I have no idea what this is. In the example they use
the third input parameter (argv[3]) and a random number to generate
"r.blkno"... but I don't know what
        it is used for
    c) Request size (bytecount): this is pretty self expanatory. My issue
is this: what is the "unit" of this parameter? Is it in bytes? In sectors?
According to what I've read it must be
        in bytes, because there is a line where this value is divided by
512 (which is the sector size), thus resulting in a one-sector size... if
this value is less than 512, there is an assert
        that fails (bcount > 0  turns out to be false). Can someone tell
me, then, what is the unit of this field?

2) Part of this project requires the simulation of errors (say, a disk
failure, a bus failure, etc)... does Disksim provide this kind of
simulation? (The probability of failure of a disk given
    some information about it, like how old it is, the type and brand, etc).

3) My question about the device number brings me to another issue: if it is
possible to send requests to different disks, is it possible to process
each request at the same time?

Hi,

Just a few quick answers to help you get started:

1)
   a) You can specify multiple disks in a .parv file without using 
disksim_iomap, and devno would be then used to distinguish between the 
different disks.
   b) blkno is the sector number. The default size of a sector is 512 bytes.
   c) bytecount is the number of bytes. It needs to be divisible by the 
sector size (usually 512 bytes).

I am not sure about 2) or 3), but here is what I think:

2) To the best of my knowledge, there is not much support for this. The 
SSD module simulates the wearing out of flash. I didn't yet find 
anything else that would simulate a failure.

3) I think you should be able to do this...

I hope this helps.

Best,
-Peter

Dear users,
     Have you ever used the intel trace generator named open storage toolkit to generate synthetic trace??Do you know how to generate the synthetic trace with it??Where to find the generated synthetic trace??
     Thank you for your answer!

Subject: [Disksim-users] Why only few trace(244) were handled when I tried
	to run 10000 traces.
Message-ID: <CAAb6sL0-Dc1c=59H6HoTvR4cRB4Y9FNHzRYMgSUTr5aw0uXT1g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,
I use the disksim && ssdsim for two months. I try to use them at the same
time. But there is something weired. I use 10'000 traces or synthetic trace
generator to test the system. Only a few traces at the beginning of trace
file, more or less 200, were handled when the simulator stopped. I don't
know why. Does anybody have similar experience? Please let me know. So
appreciate.

I attach the relevant files so that some helper could take a look. Also,
here is the link to my project:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nhavksi2jx5zfdg/Y8OFYsO4ux


I write down all the problems on the "readme at first.txt". It is too long,
so I put them into one file according to your suggestion. The folder
HybridDiskSim is the project I am using. And my host operating system is
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
link to dropbox:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nhavksi2jx5zfdg/Y8OFYsO4ux



 (1) When I use the synthetic trace for SSD, the number of maximum traces
handled is 244. I don't know why.
     the command I used like:
     ./src/disksim example_ssd.parv example_ssd.outv ascii 0 1

     I record the synthetic trace into the file synthetic_ssd.trace.  The
last item in this trace seems weird(Both SSD and HDD).
     It should be 0 or 1, but the value is 400000003

      0.000000    1    31853640    8    3
            0.132504    1    31853648    8    40000003
            0.265008    1    31853656    8    40000003
            0.397512    1    31853664    8    40000003
            0.530016    1    31853672    8    40000003
            0.662520    1    31853680    8    40000003
      ...........................



   also, the ssd statistics is weird. Only 43 requests handled.
Furthermore, all of 43 requests are read. No one write.

        ssd Total Requests handled:    43

Message-ID: <CACpOm-846trqjwpYkBwH4Q7W0W9-Ygd+NkqW7JTQCAA1SHxzSA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I have a couple of questions:

1) How do I generate a ".diskspecs" file for some disk type? Do I have to
use DIXtrac? Or is there some other way? And, about this... does anyone
know if there is some repository of *.diskspecs somewhere?

2) I would like to test some high-availability topologies with redundancy;
something like this:

    topology disksim_iodriver ctlr0 [
        disksim_bus bus1 [
            disksim_disk disk0 []
            disksim_disk disk1 []
        ]
        disksim_bus bus2 [
            disksim_disk disk0 []
            disksim_disk disk1 []
        ]
    ]

Note that disk0 and disk0 are connected to both buses. Is it possible to
build such an architecture?

What I want to do is test some worst-case-scenarios, with some components
failing, and how would the system respond to that. That is why I need this
redundant topology.

Thanks in advance

Message-ID: <22593278.3550871339855782460.JavaMail.coremail@mailweb>


Hi,
I found An interesting phenomenon when I used the disksim to simulate a atlas 10K disk.
Assume that there is a fragment trace contains two requests. The first one's opcode is "read"
and the second is "Write", then I found that the second request's response time is very samall.
In other words, when the disk opration type changed form "R" to "W", the write opration can be
completed more quickly, why? Could someone explain this phenomenon or have some reference material to 
recommend? 
Thank you very much.

For question 1,I don't think DIXtrac can help you .I have use it work on a disk about 300G,but it dosen't work.DIXtrac will work on small disk.

This is not correct. At least in my experience Dixtrac can work for 
disks with a capacity of 300GB. Most important are two things:
1) Disk has to be a SCSI disk
2) OS has to be 32-bit

I finished extracting the model of 2 Maxtor disk (146GB & 300GB) 
including comparison graphs. You can find them here:
http://ovahldy.blogspot.de/2011/03/recent-diskmodels-for-disksim.html

For question 2:
In my opinion what you suggest requires extensive programming. At least 
I haven't seen code which would deal with broken buses...

For simplicity you may want to look at how to integrate disksim with a 
system simulator (in src/syssim). It may be easier to write your own 
outside special handling for broken busses.

Dear Sir(Miss):
     I am using disksim(V4.0). My work is to use disksim to simulate one disk(SEAGATE_ST32171W) subsystem. 
The system topology is just like this:

# system topology
topology disksim_iodriver driver0 [
   disksim_bus bus0 [ 
      disksim_ctlr ctlr0 [ 
         disksim_bus bus1 [ 
            disksim_disk disk0 []
         ] # end of bus1
      ] # end of ctlr0
   ] # end of bus0
] # end of system topology

My input is a a series of requests(Request arrival time,Device number,Block number,Request size,Request flags)
in a ascii file. The output I want to get is the response time per request and the situation of per request
hit cache, but the disksim only output the statistic information of all requests. so I want to consult some questions

1,What should I do to get the response time and hitting situation of per request? 

2,The default input format is a simple ASCII stream (or file),which is the unit of "Request arrival time" and 
"Request size",Seconds milliseconds or microseconds? KB or block?

3,The ascii.trace in the valid folder has 100000 requests, but when I run disksim ascii.parv stdout ascii ascii.trace 0,
there was only 99993 requests were handled(I have modified the system topology and iomap),Why lost seven request?

Sorry for the my poor english,thank you.

Best wishs.

I obtained the response time by modifying the source code. When a
request is serviced, disk_acctimestats() is called. I got the response
time by subtracting the current timestamp (i.e. disksim->simtime) by
the arrival time of the request. You may need to modify Disksim to
carry the arrival time from the I/O driver down to the disk

"hitting situation"? Do you mean the cache hit/miss?

ms
request size is in blocks of 512B/block

> 3,The ascii.trace in the valid folder has 100000 requests, but when I run disksim ascii.parv stdout ascii ascii.trace 0,

as I remember from Disksim 3.0, when the trace runs out,
disksim->stop_sim is set to TRUE to stop the simulation, which is
before all requests are serviced. I believe that's the reason.

Good luck

I have tried it as your said steps, but failed. disk_acctimestats() is only 
called 88733 times(100000 Requests total), and it only have access time,
where could I get the current timestamp? what does the meaning of "You 
may need to modify Disksim to carry the arrival time from the I/O 
driver down to the disk"? The arrival time should be the time arrival disk?

Overall I/O System Total Requests handled:    99997
Overall I/O System Requests per second:       65.231783
Overall I/O System Completely idle time:      534035.035583       0.348371
Overall I/O System Response time average:     33.897219
Overall I/O System Response time std.dev.:    34.852530
Overall I/O System Response time maximum:    335.193345

This is part of output result of my experiment,In my opinion, the 
"Response time" here shoud be a time range from request arriving 
subsystem to Service completion, is is right? How can I get this 
response time for per request?

Could you sent me a copy of the disksim version(or source files) 
which had been modified exactly to output the respnse time 
for per request? Thank you very much.

Yes, I mean cache hit/miss.

I see, but what was the reason for the trace runs out? How can I avoid
this?

Hi,

I can only help you with the first issue. Please have a look at the 
.parv file you are using.

disksim_global Global {
   Init Seed = 42,
   Real Seed = 42,
   Stat definition file = statdefs
   Detailed execution trace = exectrace
}

The last option generates the information you want to know about how 
long every request took on a per request basis. It writes it into the 
file you provide as an argument.

It does not include whether or not an access was cached, but you can 
tell from the time it took to process the request. If a request has 0 
response time it is very likely that it was cached.

dcjy, I would highly recommend you to try out Anjo's suggestion re:
using the "Detailed execution trace" option to obtain per-request
response time. My solution requires (pretty) extensive modifications
of the source code. I do regret that I did not learn about that
option.

Thank you very much, Anjo.

For Question 3, as I said, it is because Disksim terminates a
simulation under some conditions. In my situation, Disksim terminates
a simulation when the trace runs out of requests. I did the following
to force Disksim to not to terminate till all requests are serviced.
In getnextevent(), I commented out the line disksim->stop_sim = TRUE
(line 641, as shown below).

However, it works for my simulated configurations and I am not sure it
will work for yours (I hope so). Good luck!

 622 INLINE static event * getnextevent ()
 623 {
 624    event *curr = getfromintq();
 625    event *temp;
 626
 627    if (curr) {
 628         disksim->last_event_time = simtime;
 629
 630         #ifdef DISKSIM_DEBUG
 631         printf("DISKSIM_DEBUG: getnextevent(), last_event_time= %lf\n",
 632                 disksim->last_event_time);
 633         #endif
 634
 635       simtime = curr->time;
 636
 637       if (curr->type == NULL_EVENT) {
 638         if ((disksim->iotrace) && io_using_external_event(curr)) {
 639           if ((temp =
io_get_next_external_event(disksim->iotracefile)) ==      NULL) {
 640         #ifndef RUN_UNTIL_REQUESTS_EXHAUSTED
 641             disksim->stop_sim = TRUE;
 642         #endif
 643                 disksim->trace_exhausted = 1;
 644
 645                 #ifdef DISKSIM_DEBUG
 646                 printf("DISKSIM_DEBUG: getnextevent(), trace out

 647                 #endif

Subject: [Disksim-users] some issues about disksim(V4.0)
Message-ID: <22033298.736871331033343958.JavaMail.coremail@mailweb>


Hello everyone,
     
     I am using disksim(v4.0) to get the response time of a request. 
With the help from Anjo and Yipkei, I have solved some issues. 
Thank you very much. But there are many issues confused me all the same.

     1, Where the data in the file disksim4.0/valid/ascii.trace is 
from,a really trace set collected from one application or generated 
by disksim itself? 

     2, Is there anyone who is familiar with the data download from 
the site:http://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Storage/Storage ?
What's the meaning of "application specific unit(ASU)" mentioned in
its specification file? Is it the same with the device number in trace
file?

     3, Followed Anjo's advice,I add a option in .parv file(identified by #)
to get the finish time of every request.
disksim_global Global {
   Init Seed = 42,
   Real Seed = 42,
   Stat definition file = statdefs
#  Detailed execution trace = exectrace.rlt
}
It really works. However, it only contains simtime and blkno(as shown below),
if the scheduling policy is not FCFS, the request's served order is different 
from the intput order, so,how to identify the corresponding relationship 
between the request trace and the simtime in exectrace.rlt file?
Could it record other information such as start_time,and so on,to identify them?

void iodriver_access_complete (int iodriverno, intr_event *intrp)
{
   .........   
   disksim_exectrace("Request completion: simtime %f, devno %d, blkno %d, time %f\n", 
		     simtime, req->devno, req->blkno);
   .........
}

Best Wishs.

Hi,

I have a basic question regarding the UMass traces available at
http://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Storage/Storage. I have observed
that there are 7 disks in total in the Financial2.spc trace, now my
question is there a single address space for all the disks and if so
what is the stripe size of address distribution.

Hi
My gcc version is 4.6.1 and my bison version is 2.4.1.
When do make in Disksim main folder. There will be two main problems need
to fix.
1 Some math library can not be found due to library dependency on math
library.

Solution Search LDFLAGS in each Makefile and put -lm at the end of LDFLAGS
or link sequence.
Change src/Makefile
LDFLAGS = *-lm -L*.  -ldisksim $(DISKMODEL_LDFLAGS) $(MEMSMODEL_LDFLAGS) \
                            $(LIBPARAM_LDFLAGS) $(LIBDDBG_LDFLAGS)
to
LDFLAGS = -ldisksim $(DISKMODEL_LDFLAGS) $(MEMSMODEL_LDFLAGS) \
                            $(LIBPARAM_LDFLAGS) $(LIBDDBG_LDFLAGS) *-lm -L.
*

Change memsmodel/Maefile
$(CC) -o $@ mems_seektest.o *$(LDFLAGS)* $(CFLAGS) -lmems_internals
to
$(CC) -o $@ mems_seektest.o $(CFLAGS) -lmems_internals *$(LDFLAGS)*
*
*
2 src/disksim_iosim.c:712:4: error: duplicate case value
disksim_iosim.c:712:4: error: previously used here
Due to StaticAssert (sizeof(ioreq_event) <= DISKSIM_EVENT_SIZE);
Where* #define StaticAssert(c) switch (c) case 0: case (c): *
What is the meaning of this StaticAssert.
I do not understand the meaning of this assert. If c is 0, because there is
no break, it will still go to case(c). If c is not 0, it directly go to
case(c).
It sounds to me this is totally no use.
So just comment it. Then everything works fine and compile successful.

Is this actually a code bug?
Hopes developer can fix this in Makefile and disksim_iosim.c if this is a
code bug.

Hi Qingpeng,

The code was written several years ago, and is not currently maintained 
to follow updates to the C understood by gcc. Thanks for providing some 
assistance.

Can you provide more details on this? What function is it not finding? I 
don't have gcc-4.6 at hand right now to test.

This provides a way of having compilation fail after preprocessing. If 
the condition is false (c == 0), the code will be "switch(0) case 0: 
case 0:", which is invalid because there are two case statements with 
the same label.

If you are hitting this, it means your structures are larger than 
expected by the developers. Are you running on a 64 bit system? AFAIK, 
disksim will only work on a 32 bit system.

Greetings,
Michael.

Hi

About the first problem I'm not sure.

About the second problem, that assert is designed so that you can't compile
in a 64 bit architecture. Basically it compares the size of the ioreq_event
struct with a certain value, but in 64 bits this comparison is 0. So, when
the assert is called, it is called as "switch(0) case 0: case 0"  (two case
0), which is a compile time error (duplicate case value). There is a guide
for compiling in 64 bit, but I don't have it right now. I can send it to
you tomorrow if you're not in a hurry =D

Hope this helps!

Hi:
I downloaded the trace file WebSearch3.spc from the website http://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Power/Power, and I use it as input of disksim, but it comes the following problem:
Wrong number of arguments for I/O trace event type
line: 0,614384,16384,R,0.013989
*** assertion failed: in iotrace_ascii_get_ioreq_event() (disksim_iotrace.c:596): 0:

I looked at disksim support the trace file format is not in this format, the WebSearch3.spc's trace format like :
1,8700496,16384,R,0.123685
1,25290720,32768,R,0.135333

1,13203184,8192,R,0.145195
 How do I use this trace file?
                                                                                   Zhaohu Li

hello?

    of course you can no use the raw trace, as you said the format is
totally different. the format should be :
    21698.968000   0   835         4      0
    21843.149000   0   59031     1      1
    21875.917000   0   59031     1      0
 the first column is arrival time ,second is device no?3rd is lba? 4th is
block size , 5th is operation flag(0 is write ,1 is read )
 for  WebSearch3.spc's trace:
    the first column is device no , because flashsim can only support
single device , you should make  all the device to be 0; 2nd is lba; 3rd is
byte number whick should be divided by 512 to be a block size;  4th
is operation flag; 5th is arrival time, because the arrival time interval
is too short , so it will appear the saturation wrong? and you
should amplify the arrival time interval?
    if you want to use WebSearch3.spc's trace, you should change the
format. And I think awk is good tool for this .
Hope this can help you.

Hello,

>From reading the list archives, I see the problem with sqrt being undefined during installation isn't new:
https://sos.ece.cmu.edu/pipermail/disksim-users/2011-December/000699.html
http://cboard.cprogramming.com/c-programming/144182-gcc-compile-problem-link.html

The details are below, but my question is on fixing this. Did I make a mistake during installation, or is this normal? If the error is normal, how can it be fixed?

On a fresh installation of Ubuntu 12.04 64bit, I ran the following commands to get started with disksim:

sudo apt-get install flex bison

tar xzf disksim-4.0.tar.gz

Hello,

Komal Shah's screenshot is of the same problem I mentioned below and never received a reply on.

The purpose of this email is to see if there are any developers or other active people reading this list: Are you here?

Thanks,

Ben

Subject: [Disksim-users] sqrt problem during make

Hello,

>From reading the list archives, I see the problem with sqrt being undefined during installation isn't new:
https://sos.ece.cmu.edu/pipermail/disksim-users/2011-December/000699.html
http://cboard.cprogramming.com/c-programming/144182-gcc-compile-problem-link.html

The details are below, but my question is on fixing this. Did I make a mistake during installation, or is this normal? If the error is normal, how can it be fixed?

On a fresh installation of Ubuntu 12.04 64bit, I ran the following commands to get started with disksim:

sudo apt-get install flex bison
wget http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/PDL-FTP/DriveChar/disksim-4.0.tar.gz
tar xzf disksim-4.0.tar.gz
cd disksim-4.0
make

The output from "make" is

Thanks for the fix Peter.

If this is all known, what is the route for getting the source code fixed?

Kindly,


Ben

Subject: Re: [Disksim-users] FW: sqrt problem during make

I haven't used disksim in more than a year (so I am not an active user by any means), but your email prompted me to do some research about how I solved this.

In memsmodel/Makefile, just change:

mems_seektest: mems_seektest.o libmems_internals.a
         $(CC) -o $@ mems_seektest.o $(LDFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -lmems_internals

to:

mems_seektest: mems_seektest.o libmems_internals.a
         $(CC) -o $@ mems_seektest.o $(CFLAGS) -lmems_internals $(LDFLAGS)

This should hopefully fix the sqrt problem. (I am not sure if that's all you need, but see if this helps.)

The duplicate case value is a result of a static assertion that checks to make sure that you are running on a 32-bit system. For 64-bit systems, you can get a patch from here:
http://scobyseo.blogspot.com/2009/12/disksim-40-ssd-extention-64bit-patch.html
The patch did not apply cleanly for me, so I had to apply it manually, and then it worked (plus you should feel free to ignore the ssdmodel part if you are not using the SSD extensions).

Best,
-Peter

Subject: [Disksim-users] FW: sqrt problem during make

Message-ID: <509A6887.1090803@eecs.harvard.edu>

I haven't used disksim in more than a year (so I am not an active user 
by any means), but your email prompted me to do some research about how 
I solved this.

In memsmodel/Makefile, just change:

mems_seektest: mems_seektest.o libmems_internals.a
         $(CC) -o $@ mems_seektest.o $(LDFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -lmems_internals

to:

mems_seektest: mems_seektest.o libmems_internals.a
         $(CC) -o $@ mems_seektest.o $(CFLAGS) -lmems_internals $(LDFLAGS)

This should hopefully fix the sqrt problem. (I am not sure if that's all 
you need, but see if this helps.)

The duplicate case value is a result of a static assertion that checks 
to make sure that you are running on a 32-bit system. For 64-bit 
systems, you can get a patch from here:
http://scobyseo.blogspot.com/2009/12/disksim-40-ssd-extention-64bit-patch.html
The patch did not apply cleanly for me, so I had to apply it manually, 
and then it worked (plus you should feel free to ignore the ssdmodel 
part if you are not using the SSD extensions).

Best,
-Peter

Also, I forgot to mention that there is also a DiskSim-only patch 
without the SSD modules:

Hello again,

I finally got around to testing Peter's suggestion of moving "$(LDFLAGS)" to the end of mems_seektest in memsmodel/Makefile
Unfortunately this doesn't get me any further than the other method I tried previously,
> cd memsmodel
> gcc -Wall -Wno-unused -MD -o mems_seektest mems_seektest.o -lm -L. -g -DASSERTS  -I../src// -I../ -I../src//src -lmems_internals -lm cd ..

Here's the full story of what I did:

sudo apt-get install flex bison
cd
wget http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/PDL-FTP/DriveChar/disksim-4.0.tar.gz
tar xzf disksim-4.0.tar.gz
cd disksim-4.0
# running "make" at this point yields the " undefined reference to `sqrt' " problem
gedit memsmodel/Makefile
# change
    mems_seektest: mems_seektest.o libmems_internals.a
         $(CC) -o $@ mems_seektest.o $(LDFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -lmems_internals
# to
mems_seektest: mems_seektest.o libmems_internals.a
         $(CC) -o $@ mems_seektest.o $(CFLAGS) -lmems_internals $(LDFLAGS)
make

Thanks for the fix Peter.

If this is all known, what is the route for getting the source code fixed?

Kindly,


Ben

Subject: Re: [Disksim-users] FW: sqrt problem during make

I haven't used disksim in more than a year (so I am not an active user by any means), but your email prompted me to do some research about how I solved this.

In memsmodel/Makefile, just change:

mems_seektest: mems_seektest.o libmems_internals.a
         $(CC) -o $@ mems_seektest.o $(LDFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -lmems_internals

to:

mems_seektest: mems_seektest.o libmems_internals.a
         $(CC) -o $@ mems_seektest.o $(CFLAGS) -lmems_internals $(LDFLAGS)

This should hopefully fix the sqrt problem. (I am not sure if that's all you need, but see if this helps.)

The duplicate case value is a result of a static assertion that checks to make sure that you are running on a 32-bit system. For 64-bit systems, you can get a patch from here:
http://scobyseo.blogspot.com/2009/12/disksim-40-ssd-extention-64bit-patch.html
The patch did not apply cleanly for me, so I had to apply it manually, and then it worked (plus you should feel free to ignore the ssdmodel part if you are not using the SSD extensions).

Best,
-Peter

Subject: [Disksim-users] Simulation stopped because of saturation
Message-ID: <CA+pqC5i8dgWGM=eKgNqXRC5A-Q5vNQ2xD4gK-jxy+QXN1RfQ8Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Disksim users,

I tried to run disksim simulator with a trace file but sometime there
is a problem like this:
simulation stopped because of saturation.

What can I do to fix this kind of problem?

Hi All,For the modern disk, the seek curves for read and write are different, i.e., there is around 5% difference. However, in disksim, only one curve is supported. Any part to change?Thanks,William Smith

Subject: [Disksim-users] recruitment of volunteers for code analysis
Message-ID: <SNT107-DS70DF4B6D778536BF40BA0DA420@phx.gbl>

Dear all,

 

It is no doubt that Disks is one of the most accuracy storage device
simulators. However, it lacks of documentation on the code, although it is
essential for those developers. Hence, I try to recruit some volunteers to
do the code analysis. It would be a dirty job. But if one person only takes
charge of 2-4 source files, it would not be so heavy. I will divide the
codes into several parts according to HDD structure. 2-4 persons will look
into one part. 

If you are interested in it, please reply me to askool99 at hotmail.com. My
target is 10-20 persons. If so, I will send the volunteers some outline
structures, and assign the task according to your interest.

 

All the very best!

Message-ID: <9E442330-61B4-4DD1-B708-9D49FD92D97F@gmail.com>

Hi,

I tried compiling DiskSim on a Ubuntu 64-bit machine with 3.2.0-29-generic kernel. I ran into some problems and fixed them later with the help of some googling and some experimenting. I thought I would send an email collecting the changes I had to do.

# Problem 1: Disksim-4.0 does not compile on 64-bit machine.

Symptom: An error about "duplicate case"

Solution: Apply the 64-bit patch found here: http://code.google.com/p/sst-simulator/downloads/detail?name=disksim_4.0_64bit.patch

# Problem 2: Problems due to math linking errors

Symptom: undefined reference to 'log', 'sqrt' and so on.

Solution: Change the Makefiles so that in LDFLAGS definition, the "-lm" part is at the end of the line.

For example:  Change LDFLAGS = -L. -lm -ldisksim $(DISKMODEL_LDFLAGS) 
to
LDFLAGS = -L. -ldisksim $(DISKMODEL_LDFLAGS) -lm

Hope this helps anyone else running into the same problem.

Thanks,
Vijay

Message-ID: <CANT-efcch9d3aaEC-U2PpedBJiYPB=hL7o1ZQBB0tn2CDY_GvA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all
I used Disksim with Microsoft SSD add-on.

*Is there any particular function for handling write requests in Disksim?
Or How disksim calculate the logical address of incoming request?*
*
*
At first, I thought it would be the "ssd_logical_pageno" function in
"ssd.c" file.
But it seems that disksim is using another address translation between APN
and LPN.
Because changin the output of function will not result in different
distribution of blocks lifetime.

Does anyone know about this?

Thanks in advance

Dear disksim users,

Is it possible to get an estimation of access time of a request in the disksim?
I have looked at the code and it says that the acctime estimation is
not currently supported,
is there any other alternative to do this? the estimated access time
does not have to be very
accurate though.

thank you.

Hi,

Answering this question is not so simple, since I do not know where you 
would like to use the estimate. (outside or within disksim) I'm asuming 
that you would like to get the estimate within disksim, but outside the 
diskctlr. So that you could e.g. decide which disk or replica of content 
should serve the request, if multiple disks/blocks hold the same content 
(but are in different states/content has different location).

I cannot give you an entire recipe, but I think what you're looking for 
can be found in the disk model interface dm_mech_if in diskmodel/dm.h. 
This interface holds functions to account for entire access time, 
rotational or seek latency, translate between various models of state 
representation... I'm not saying that it is very handy to use, but the 
functionality is there...

Now the question is how do you get the implementation of the interface 
for a specific disk and the current state of the disk. Using the getdisk 
(globally available) fct call... It gives back a structure containing 
current state (which is required for most of the interface functions) as 
well as the implementation of the interface.

getdisk itself needs only an integer to return the disk - and this makes 
it tricky to use. Depending on your implementation it can be difficult 
to know which disk should serve the request. The latest point at which 
one can decide the disk is in the controller (smart, simple or your 
implementation).

Message-ID: <508910E3.40800@gmail.com>

Hello all Disksim-users,

Currently I am working with Disksim.
However, I am confused with many things so I would like to ask you many 
questions and hope you will be able spend a little time to help me.

1. In "ssd-iozone.parv" file:
- Line 181, Page size = 8
- What is the unit sie of page size (Kilo byte or others) ?

2. If page size is 8 KB, so size of a block is 512KB. However, when I 
calculate read block transfer time and write block transfer time, there 
are no any results which math in parameter file

-----------------------------------------
Read block transfer time = 0.0002384,
Write block transfer time = 0.0002384,
#Read block transfer time = 0.0016276,
#Write block transfer time = 0.0016276,
------------------------------------------

My calculation is

* If data transfer is 2GBps --> time = 0.000262144 (second)
* If data transfer is 2Gbps --> time = 0.002097152 (second)
* If data transfer is 30MBps --> time = 0.01747626 (second)

Hi!

There is a thread from December, 2011, where I asked how to compile on 64
bit. Peter Macko answered with a link to a blog which contains the
instructions on how to do it (you have to modify some sources, but applying
the patch is quite simple).

Just look for that thread and for Peter's answer, and you should be able to
compile no problem =)

    when timescale change from 1 to 0.1, the interval between two

   so, execution time will become longer ~

Message-ID: <CAAb6sL2H=gJrOFDowcb7qvCHEy59o1owVtzCQ2kyW0ZqvPcbpw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

When I was testing the system simulator(Disksim) using a big trace file, it
runs a long time. However, it shows up the error "./src/syssim: internal
error: last event not completed." after 30 minutes (depending on the trace
file). Does anybody get into the same trouble before?

If you encountered the same error like mine, could you tell me the possible
reasons in details about it one by one? That would be very helpful for me.

It is not easy to find out the issue. I think the Disksim is not perfect
and it has some hidden problems itself. So just write down your experience
for me.

I am so appreciated for your help!!! Thanks.

The below function located in the file syssim_driver.c

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
...........

    if (!completed) {
      fprintf(stderr,
          "%s: internal error. Last event not completed %d\n",
          argv[0], i);
      exit(1);
    }
...............
}

Subject: [Disksim-users] IO Scheduling within Disk
Message-ID: <CAMNVjg9D4GyHjbbtas04nanNvvbgyoHy-DWFUkeP3PBAPT5mpg@mail.gmail.com>

*

Hi DiskSim Users,

I am trying to simulate in-disk scheduling algorithm to determine the
effect of interleaving OS IO scheduling and in-disk IO scheduling
(scheduling within the disk). To test this feature I modified the
scheduling policy bit in diskspecs file and ran the simulation using ascii
trace file. However, I noticed that the ?Overall I/O System Response time
average? along with other parameters remained unaffected from the choice of
scheduling algorithm used in disk. These parameters did change when I
changed the scheduling policy at the driver level, i.e, in the parv file.

Further Investigation:

I investigated further and found that ?Max queue length? parameter for the
disk was set to 1 in diskspecs file. My intuition was that for any
scheduling to take place at disk level, it has to queue more than 1 IO
request. So I ran the test again after changing this value to x (any where
from 2 to 10000).  However, this created another problem. After changing
Max queue length,I found that disksim simulated only  36 IO requests (seen
from ?Overall I/O System Total Requests handled? trace output) out of
nearly 10K IO requests in trace file. Note that disksim did not error out
while running this test, it simply processed less number of IOs. Also the
overall response time did not change with different choice of scheduling
algorithm at disk level.

I am not sure what is causing this problem. Simply put my intention is to
run disk-level scheduling and observe output characteristics. I would be
glad to share the parv and trace file if someone is interested in running
the test on their end.

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,
Prashant Saxena *

Subject: [Disksim-users] Cannot have 2 synthetic workload generators - 1 for
 time-critical, 1 for time-noncritical requests
Message-ID: <CAF75uxzoyH9DzCovoKKyfEcPnoLLnDfdQLasLNfFur_9bF780g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Disksim users,

This is what I want to simulate.
* 3 concurrent synthetic workload generators
* the 1st 2 generate time-critical requests (i.e. each may have only 1
pending request)
* the 3rd generates time-noncritical requests (i.e. may have >1 pending request)

I posted the Disksim parameter files (.parv) and output files (.outv)
on my website. Please note that, for some reason, I have to append the
file names with ".txt" on the web site.

Settings
* I created my parameter file
(http://utminers.utep.edu/ykwok2/tmp/synthopen.3.parv.txt) based on
synthopen.parv that comes with the Disksim 4.0
* there are 3 disks. Each synthetic generator accessed its own disk
* changes I made
i. Number of processors
synthopen.parv:    1
synthopen.3.parv: 3
ii. "Probability of time-critical request" of the 1st 2 synthetic generators
synthopen.parv:    0.0 (i.e. Probability of time-critical request =  0.0)
synthopen.3.parv: 1.0 (i.e. Probability of time-critical request =  1.0)

Problem:
* The 1st 2 synthetic workload generators, each, generated only 1
request. After the requests were serviced, they did not generate
another request.

Details:
* output file (http://utminers.utep.edu/ykwok2/tmp/synthopen.3.outv.txt)
* I got into this problem on an unmodified version of Disksim 4 (vanilla).
* Number of requests generated by each generator.
$ grep -i 'Number of I/O requests' ./synthopen.3.outv
Process Number of I/O requests:  10002
Process 3 Number of I/O requests:  1
Process 4 Number of I/O requests:  1
Process 5 Number of I/O requests:  10000

* Number of requests serviced by the disks
$ grep -i 'total requests handled' ./synthopen.3.outv
Overall I/O System Total Requests handled:      10001
IOdriver Total Requests handled:        10001
IOdriver #0 device #0 Total Requests handled:   1
IOdriver #0 device #1 Total Requests handled:   1
IOdriver #0 device #2 Total Requests handled:   9999

Note:
* this problem does not happen when either all synthetic generators
generate time-critical or all synthetic workload generators generate
time-noncritical accesses.
* Case I: all generators generate time-critical access
Parameter file: http://utminers.utep.edu/ykwok2/tmp/synthopen.2.parv.txt
Output file:      http://utminers.utep.edu/ykwok2/tmp/synthopen.2.outv.txt
$ grep -i 'total requests handled' ./synthopen.2.outv
Overall I/O System Total Requests handled:      10001
IOdriver Total Requests handled:        10001
IOdriver #0 device #0 Total Requests handled:   3387
IOdriver #0 device #1 Total Requests handled:   3253
IOdriver #0 device #2 Total Requests handled:   3361
* all generators generate time-noncritical access
Parameter file: http://utminers.utep.edu/ykwok2/tmp/synthopen.5.parv.txt
Output file:      http://utminers.utep.edu/ykwok2/tmp/synthopen.5.outv.txt
$ grep -i 'total requests handled' ./synthopen.5.outv
Overall I/O System Total Requests handled:      9998
IOdriver Total Requests handled:        9998
IOdriver #0 device #0 Total Requests handled:   3438
IOdriver #0 device #1 Total Requests handled:   3313
IOdriver #0 device #2 Total Requests handled:   3247


Looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you very much.

Regards,
Yipkei

are you sure you follow the instruction (readme file) in the SSD extension
folder?

1- Apply this add-on by unpacking the enclosed into the ssdmodel
subdirectory of the DiskSim source tree (so as to be *parallel* to
memsmodel, etc.)

2-  Then run the following patch script.
    patch -p1 < ssdmodel/ssd-patch

3- make (make clean)

hello saeedeh alinezhad,
1)i had already did that patching successfully,and i solved the problem
arises after patching (math.h problem eg undefined reference to 'sqrt' etc)
by making some changes to makefiles(adjusting -lm argument) .i got the
mention error after doing these things
plz help

hello saeed ghasemi
thnx for your your suggestion i will try it on ubuntu 10.04 ,if possible
could u tell exact version of GCC,FLEX and BISON i should use.
currently i am using gcc(4.6.3),flex(2.5.35) and bison(2.5)

Message-ID: <CAC9+anLGdgou6f2qOCXDnzTsn5pm_2qaxjFRGhsjtWpnT3C+Lw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

As I wanted to play a bit with disksim I found that it didn't work for
64bit and while there were some patches and even a few github
repositories floating around I didn't find any of the prior solutions
to work very well.

I have now published my own attempt at cleaning up disksim at
https://github.com/baruch/disksim

This is mostly valgrind clean, except for the very last test with
which I am still battling. I have also tried to cleanup some of the
many warnings in the code but that would take far longer to cleanup
than I really intended to spend on disksim itself.

Could anyone help me out with this?

*Hi all,*
*
*
*for simulating RAID-4 by using SSD, i have changed ssd-iozone.parv file in
this way:*

instantiate [ ssd0x0 .. ssd0x3 ] as  SSD

# system topology
topology disksim_iodriver driver0 [
     disksim_bus bustop [
         ############## HBA 0 #############################
          disksim_ctlr ctlrHBA0 [
               disksim_bus busHBA0 [
                  ############## Flash-device Raid Controller
###############
                    ssdmodel_ssd ssd0x0 [],
     ssdmodel_ssd ssd0x1 [],
    ssdmodel_ssd ssd0x2 [],
     ssdmodel_ssd ssd0x3 []
               ]     # end of bus0
         ]        # end of HBA0
          ############ INSERT MORE HBA's ##############################
######
     ]           # end of bustop
]              # end of driver0 (and system topology)


*also i have changed logorg block in **ssd-iozone.parv**:*

disksim_logorg org0 {
   Addressing mode = Array,
   Distribution scheme = Striped,
   Redundancy scheme = Parity_disk,

   # vp - added more ssd elements
   devices = [ ssd0x0 .. ssd0x3 ],

   Stripe unit  =  128,
   Synch writes for safety =  0,
   Number of copies =  2,
   Copy choice on read =  6,
   RMW vs. reconstruct =  0.5,
   Parity stripe unit =  128,
   Parity rotation type =  1,
   Time stamp interval =  0.000000,
   Time stamp start time =  60000.000000,
   Time stamp stop time =  10000000000.000000,
   Time stamp file name =  stamps
} # end of logorg org0 spec

*Is there any other changes in .parv file or ssd.c, ssd.h and so on ???*
*or that's enough for simulating RAID-4 ???*

Subject: [Disksim-users] Problems with rotational latenxy
Message-ID: <5119DB07.7080702@cs.wisc.edu>

Hi,
I'm trying to simulate a single disk (HDD) using disksim 4.0.
* The I/O subsystem architecture is very simple : 
driver->bus->controller->bus->disk.
* I just need to simulate 1ms latency overall from the time the request 
came (read from trace) to when it reaches the disk.
* The input that I'm trying to simulate is synchronous writes (for which 
I have an idea of how the output will look like). I need to verify that 
the disksim is
    configured so testing it with this input. I have also disabled disk 
block cache for this reason.
* Average Rotational latency of the disk is 11ms.
* I'm measuring access time for each request and plotting it against 
sector number. The output looks very similar to what I'm expecting 
except for one thing :
   -> the access times for initial few writes is low. Normally, this is 
fine as the disk starts at sector 0 and input requests are also in 
increasing order of sector.
   -> however, due to latency I have introduced in the controller (bulk 
sector transfer time : 1.0), it should be something like this :
        at time 0ms, request for sector 0 comes, it writes and now head 
points to sector 1 (I write only one sector per request)
        after 1ms, request for sector 1 comes. Now by this time, the 
disk head should have moved past sector 1 and hence should complete a 
full rotation
        before it comes to sector 1.
     So the first few sector requests should incur high latency. yes? 
However I do not find this happening. Does the disk start rotating at 
time 0 (when request
     is at the highest level i.e read from file) or does it start when 
the request actually reaches the disk? If its the latter, is there 
anyway to move the head
     past a few sector based on the rotational latency?

I'm attaching both the expected and actual latency graphs.
Thanks a lot!

Best
Siva

Hi,all.
Recently,I use FlashSim to do some simulations. Now, I want to know the average request size of Financial1 trace. From the paper such as "WAFTL: A Workload Adaptive Flash Translation?Layer with Data Partition","DFTL",they give the average request size, I don't know how they get the value.I have two ways to get the value, but I don't know if it is right.?
1.From the output file of Flashsim, there are "Request size stats","Read Request size stats", "Write Request size stats",I can get the average value of average request size, I think the unit size is the same as the ascii trace, i.e.,512bytes(in the statdefs file, the Request size entry, the Scale is 1).
2.I get the value through?caculate the average of the "bcount" in the trace.
I don't know which is right.

In addition, I found that the request size is just not the same as the bcount in the trace. For example,
Overall I/O System Request size distribution

average request size is calculated by the statistics of original trace. it
has nothing to do with the simulator.

Hi,Wang Wei. thank you for your reply.
I have some questions about the "average request size","write ratio","sequential ratio" and "average inter-arrival time" of one trace. As most papers had cited, write ratio and average inter-arrival time can be get from the simulation output file. And they are the same as the one get from the original trace. So, why the average request size can not get from the output file? I think the simulator just give the statistics about the trace. But I don't know why the average request size is wrong.
In addition, how can i get the "sequential ratio" of one trace? what's the metrics for sequential request? That is, how to judge whether a request(or requests) is sequential?
Sorry for my poor English.?

Dear,all
Does anyone have used the SSD model(ssd-add-on.zip) with disksim4-0?  When I
compile the ssdmodel, there is an error .

 If you have the same problem and solution, please drop me a message. I will

Dear all,

Yesterday,I asked a question about compiling dismsim-4.0 with SSD,some
persons told me maybe it is a fault about 64-bit operating system,but i
check my linux version ,the result is:

Linux hs-N43SL 3.2.0-35-generic-pae #55-Ubuntu SMP Wed Dec 5 18:04:39 UTC
2012 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux

it is a 32-bit operating system.

And today i just compiled the disksim-4.0,my environment is:
flex version 2.5.4
bison (GNU Bison) 2.5
gcc version 2.95.4 20011002 (Debian prerelease)
disksim-4.0.tar.gz

I just tar the file (disksim-4.0.tar.gz)
and cd disksim-4.0
then,make

but the problem occurs:

Dear all,
I have already solved the problem.
Before I install disksim-4.0,I have already installed the disksim-3.0,and
in order to install the disksim-3.0 successfully,I degraded the gcc.That is
the problem.
Disksim-4.0 needs a high gcc version.
So I update the gcc,and re-install the disksim-4.0.and I succeed

Thanks
All the best

Message-ID: <CAC3HEeMDFdvk7bwKvtdW79kN4-v0ygcGOqYfNd75S=gvXJGg+w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I encounter the following assertion failure using disksim-4.0:
in disksim_diskctlr.c:
in function:  disk_bus_ownership_grant():
ddbg_assert(arbdelay == (simtime - currdisk->stat.requestedbus));

First, I comment this assertion, and print the corresponding values in
my simulation, finding that the failure is actually caused by the
precision problem of floating point numbers.  It appears only 3 times
and my simulation runs well after that...

So I wonder if it is a bug to compare the float numbers in this way,
or there is some special purpose  for this assertion?
Referring to a similar part in the source code of the SSD extension, I
comment this assertion and changed the line
currdisk->stat.waitingforbus += simtime - currdisk->stat.requestedbus;
into
currdisk->stat.waitingforbus += arbdelay;

Is that OK?

Thank you for your time!

Best regards,
Xunrui

Message-ID: <CAGSMsAHhoMv8CmqMYDnYxaiVXTV1GwN659tCwu_nx_q1Vrbnag@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I used disksim-3.0 to test Financial1 trace.

And I created a procedure iotrace_financial1_get_ioreq_event() in
Disksim_iotrace.c

I also made some changes in ascii.parv to fit the financial1 trace(mainly
about the devno).

but the problem occurs:
Stopping simulation because of saturation: simtime 1919.778808, totalreqs
100003
disksim_run_simulation(): simulated 118191 events

I looked up the Disksim_users Archives,and tried the following two
solutions:
1. change the value of MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH in
Disksim-3.0/src/disksim_logorg.c

2.change the value of I/O Trace Time Scale=1.0(amplify it to 2.0,3.0 even
to 10.0)

But they don't work!

If you have the same problem and solution, please drop me a message. I will
 be very appreciated.

Best regards

thanks

The value is a unfinished job
Changing it in parv file can't do anything

Hi All,

I am trying to get the different metadata reads to the disks. Metadata
reads are also similar to data reads, but my development concentrates on
the metadata read part. Can anyone please let me know how to differentiate
between a data read and a metadata read in the code and in physical disks...

Thanks,
Adarsh Jain

Subject: [Disksim-users] Synthetic workload generating module - Upper-bound
	on pending requests
Message-ID: <CAHr2BHp9fGkRXxNrVxhOgW3EpDKo=b6aDhSRdT-WgwivPsN=ug@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Disksim users,

I am using the synthetic workload generating module for my
experiments. How can I specify the maximum number of pending requests
in the I/O subsystem (I/O driver + controller + disks) of each
process?

Note: I followed the instructions on page 43 of the Disksim 4.0
reference manual; to simulate a closed subsystem model, I set the
probability that a request is time-critical to 1.0. I also set the
inter-request computation times to 0.0 to eliminate think times. As a
result, I got one pending request for each process. What I want is to
bound the maximum number of pending requests to a specific number
(say, 20). How can I do that?

Looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you very much.

Regards,
Yipkei

I saw the reference manual of DiskSim 4.0. However, it is designed for
users but not developers (those who implement new functionalities into
DiskSim). Is there a developers' manual for DiskSim?

Thank you very much.

No.  The closest thing would be the appendix to Ganger's dissertation,
though that's more of a design description than any sort of developer's
manual... and it related to the original version, rather than to 4.0.

Best luck,

Greg

Hi Anjo,

Thanks for getting back to me. I used the maxtor300g/maxtor146g models
that were released and I did look at the pdfs from the validation
stage, which do display a good correlation.

However! When you feed a completely sequential load into disksim, the
performance is on par with a completely random load, which absolutely
does not make sense.

I tracked down the issue to the disk_buffer_sector_done function
inside disksim_diskctlr.c
There are some useful printf() lines in there. What I explain was
observed with a trace containing two sequential reads with maxtor300g
* it takes a single sector for the bcount (a field which is used as a
state identifier in this function!) to go to 1. As a result, it loses
the opportunity to succeed this condition:

  if(curr->bcount == 1) {
	if(currblkno == firstblkno) {

As a result, it misses the opportunity to finish the second request
immediately and does a complete seek around the track to start the
second request. Which is pretty terrible.

As the code in this function is really complicated, a simple fix will
not work (I tried and started tripping asserts). The only way that
works for me (as I am making use of syssim) is to intentionally trim
the requests (provided they are large enough) by one or two sectors,
allowing the disk model to successfully start doing the next request
immediately. This workaround allowed me to get a 4-5x speed up in disk
model performance.

I did a comparison with one of the included disks (hp_c2490a). This
model appears to be much less detailed, anyways, apparently bcount
remains in value 1 for both the disksim requests, so I didn't observe
this bug with it!

* I only watched the outputs from maxtor300g but I suspect it is the
same for the rest of Dixtrac-generated models, because they have the
same issue with disk performance.

Regards,
-Tarihi

Subject: [Disksim-users] Problem: No. of in-flight requests bounded by 20
Message-ID: <CAF75uxwp0y1Obdb_Nxpsa4ubD5J2GRZBPxkSXFZ0gYc3Kv+twQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I want to use synthetic workload generators to simulate a scenario
where 50 single-thread independent processes are concurrently
accessing a single-disk storage system. All I/O requests are
synchronous. I expect that the number of pending request in the entire
I/O hierarchy (I/O driver + controller + disk) to be 50. However, I
found that the number of pending requests drops from 50, at the
beginning, to 20, later in the simulation.

Here is the summary of the DiskSim parv file
(http://utminers.utep.edu/ykwok2/tmp/20130710-0.parv.txt)
* I/O driver: FCFS
* single disk: MAXTOR_ATLAS10K5_300 (disk model provided by Anjo at
http://ovahldy.blogspot.com/2011/03/recent-diskmodels-for-disksim.html)
* Think time from call to request = 0.0
* Think time from request to return = 0.0
* number of synthetic workload generators = 50
* System call/return with each request = 1 (i.e., each request occurs
within the context of a system call)
Note: I gave a try to set "System call/return with each request" to 0
but I encountered the same problem.
* For each generator, Probability of time-critical request = 1.0

This is how I measure the number of pending requests in the I/O
hierarchy. I keep a counter in the simulator. When a request arrives
the I/O driver, iodriver_request() increments the counter. When a
request is serviced, iodriver_access_complete() decrements the
counter.

The plot of the number of pending requests vs. time is here
(http://utminers.utep.edu/ykwok2/tmp/Slide1.PNG). I repeated the
experiment with 35, 20, and 15 generators (all results are shown on
the same slide). The number of pending requests with 35 generators,
too, drops to 20, while the numbers of pending requests with 20 and 15
generators remain constant.

I want the number of pending requests to be 50 when 50 generators are
used. Why is the number of pending requests dropping?

Please kindly help. Thank you very much.

Regards,
Yipkei

hello, dear Yipkei Kwok

is that possible that your storage constantly finish your IO request (30
IOPS ?)

so the pending requests does not match the request rate

If a time-limited request is serviced before its time limit, does the
generator process block and wait till the end of the time limit before
generating the next request?

Thank you.

On Page 42 of the Disksim 4.0 manual,

Probability of time-limited request
"This specifies the probability that a generated request is
time-limited. That is, the corresponding generator process ?blocks?
and waits for the request to complete (if it is not already complete)
after a given amount of think time (specified by the below ?time
limit? parameters) [5, 2]."

No.  If it finishes before the time limit, its generator doesn't block
waiting on it.  Think of it like a prefetch, for example, where the
reader only blocks if the prefetch doesn't finish before the reader
actually needs the data.

Dear Dr Ganger,

Thank you very much for your prompt response.

This is what I want to do with the synthetic workload generator.
There are two generators - A and B. Both of them generate
time-critical requests with probability of 1.0. Generator A generates
the next request immediately once a request is serviced. Generator B
waits for 2000 ms to generate the next request after a request is
serviced. Can I do this using the synthetic workload generator? If
yes, how?

BTW, I don't think I can do it with the "Think time from request to
return" option of disksim_synthio because that is a global option for
all generators.

Looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you very much

Yes, I think you should be able to do that, using the parameters as
described in the guide.  Good luck!

Subject: [Disksim-users] Serious problems using dixtrac extracted parameters
Message-ID: <CA+5nn1gJOPwHxM0COhN5Fjtq4-Bs6jzkkG2UVREKWDZN9Eq6NQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have been attempting to make use of some parameters extracted via
dixtrac, such as the ones graciously provided by Anjo Vahldiek.
However, I have come across very surprising results, performance-wise.
I generated a random trace of aligned 16KB read requests and a
sequential trace of 16KB back-to-back read requests.
This is how long it took to run each trace (it is in milliseconds)
For the record, are the results obtained with the 2GB HP C2490A which
is supplied along with Disksim:
Random: 2232995.378781
Sequential: 624599.551791

To make the comparison (somewhat) fair, I had to use the same random
trace for the larger drives:

And these are the results obtained with the 300GB Maxtor drive:
Random: 237932.073905
Sequential: 619900.348468

And these are the results obtained with the 146GB Maxtor drive:
Random: 345077.024293
Sequential: 329766.817393

And these results are from the 146GB Seagate drive:
Random: 209403.240946
Sequential: 423689.049873

Basically, with the exception of *slight* difference in case of the
146GB maxtor file, the sequential trace takes longer to run, nearly
2.5x times in the worst case!

I just copied the files in the tar.gz files and used them and
layout.mappings is not necessary.

My guess is that the model generated by the tool has issues with the
modelling firmware behavior, something like the scheduling algorithm,
or maybe it is botching up the mappings?

Any help with be more than welcome :)

Regards,
-Tarihi

Hi,

In general it is difficult to reason about differences without knowing 
how you issued the requests to disks (e.g. O_direct, by SCSI cmd, 
flushing caches, ...) and which exact models you used.

My suggest is that you look at the validation step of dixtrac. At the 
end of dixtrac it runs a validation workload and produces 4 pdfs 
showing the difference between simulated & real device. (called 
mixed(.hist).pdf and random(.hist).pdf which are part of the tar) 
Especially the mixed workload in case of 146g shows a significant 
difference. The 300g model shows less differences.  (not sure which of 
the two you used) You should be able to use the code part to prodcude 
the same pdfs using your disks instead of ours.

Hopefully this helps.

Thanks,
Anjo

Dear all,

 

I?m a new user of disksim . I used disksim-3.0 to test Financial1 trace. I
made some modifies of the related files? disksim_global.h and
disksim_iotrace.c ?in the?src? folder as the disksim reference manual
said to support this new trace format .
However,  it came the following problem:
Wrong number of arguments for I/O trace event type
line: 0,303567,3584,w,0.000000
*** assertion failed: in iotrace_financial1_get_ioreq_event()
(disksim_iotrace.c:573): 0:
Aborted
As a freshman here, I don?t know what to do to deal with this situation .
Would anyone do me a favor?

Message-ID: <CAFv1vyb0JmsZoVmffO+Vnqiq_Oe3q=ye2KTrfSGbwpEoLAYtgA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Disksim Users

My research purpose is to experiment database index structures on SSDs and
HDDs for some comparisons to see benefits of the fast random reads of SSDs.
I have already installed Disksim and SSD extension. My questions are;

Is there an idealized hdd just like an idealized ssd in microsofts research?

I can't find the template trace and parameter file other than those in the
valid folder but in the documentation a template is mentioned so am I
missing something?

Make didn't compile at first so I had to put the -lm parameters at the end
of commands for some of the makefiles (src, memsmodel, dixtrac), is this
the solution or is there another way to work around this problem? (SSD
patch should be done beforehand)

Message-ID: <CAK=TG54L8AXO8-dRKhQUiWs7wD3gOOk-OsgzEcCrXDybjd1ApQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I wanna design a hybrid cache  for disksim, this cache includes SSD and
HDD, at the frist I extended disksim with SSD microsoft extension,but I
have no idea about how to design the cache with these available SSD and HDD
?

hello everyone

I wonder if it is possible to add more than one SSD in the flashsim to
create a RAID structure?
is it code support such modification???
is it possible to use the RAID of disksim and the FTL of flashsim? I mean
are their codes match with each other and portable??

Message-ID: <CAG9uKVUbzVpBPDC-tRugBOFzwE6+rDotb5-aUeZ6+6wVg+wB8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to disable a "write cache" in DiskSim 4.0.

I'm not sure which parameters in parv file that control this.
The closest I can find is "Fast write level" which I can set to level
0, 1 and 2,
and 0 should mean disable write cache in all cases.
Is this true?

Is there a better way to disable write cache?

Second, when I set "Fast write level" to 0, the disksim only ran some
of the trace.
(e.g. in a trace that have 110892 I/Os, disksim only ran 5 I/Os)

Thank you.

Best regards
Knot

Hi

Have anyone ran into this problem,
assertion failed: in disk_buffer_sector_done()
(disksim_diskctlr.c:4360): currdisk->fpcheck:

Apparently, these is this comment in the header (disksim_disk.h),
  // This is a forward progress check.  There have been a number of
  // bugs over the years that cause the controller to get into an
  // infinite loop, reading the same sector or track over and over.
  // Every time we do a reposition, this is reset (currently
  // statically, should be set to the track length) and
  // disk_buffer_sector_done() decrements it and asserts that it
  // hasn't gotten to 0.

2 questions,
1. any workaround of this bug?
2. does anyone know what is this bug?

Hi,everyone!
    I download a new trace Financial1.spc on the internet. And I made some changes of the functions just as the disksim manual says. I run the order "        ../src/disksim ascii.parv spc.outv spc Financial1.spc 0 " in the terminal. However, the results is as follows:


unexpected requests location:devno13, blkno 60364, bcout 8192


Assertion failed:
Simtime  =146.977584
totalreqs =4357
disksim:disksim_logorg.c:750:logorg_maprequest:Assertion 'logorgno !=-1' failed.
 Aborted


 What should I do to deal with it?

This is because disksim cannot find where to write your IO.
This might happen because your disk (as configured in parv file) is too small
or doesn't match topology of your trace file (e.g. trace file used
RAID but parv don't).

Solution!!!

Today I found that the culprit (at least in my case) is that one of
the IO's block count is greater than 6000.
(6000 is the *hardcoded* number of fpcheck)
So I changed to 65537 (disksim_diskctlr.c line 1920) and it was
solved! (at least for now)

Have you ever ran into this problem?
Any comment on my dirty workaround?

Hi all,

 

I found several abnormal situations that the disksim doesn't work for open
subsystem model.

 

1)      The simtime is stuck at time 0.

 

--------------------please replace the synthio of "atlas_III.parv" as
follows-------------

disksim_synthio Synthio {

   Number of I/O requests to generate =  100,

   Maximum time of trace generated  =  1000.0,

   System call/return with each request =  0,

   Think time from call to request =  0.0,

   Think time from request to return =  0.0,

Generators = [

disksim_synthgen { # generator 0 

   Storage capacity per device  =  17770250,

   devices = [ disk0 ], 

   Blocking factor =  8,

   Probability of sequential access =  0,

   Probability of local access =  0,

   Probability of read access =  0.4,

   Probability of time-critical request =  0.0,

   Probability of time-limited request =  0.0,

   Time-limited think times  = [ normal, 30.0, 100.0  ],

   General inter-arrival times  = [ exponential, 0.0, 50  ],

   Sequential inter-arrival times  = [ exponential, 0.0, 50.0  ],

   Local inter-arrival times  = [ exponential, 0.0, 50.0  ],

   Local distances  = [ normal, 0.0, 40000.0  ],

   Sizes  = [ exponential, 0.0, 8.0  ]

} # end of generator 0 

] # end of generator list 

} # end of synthetic workload spec

-------------------------------------

 

2)      Unexpected request location

--------------------please replace the synthio of "hp_c3323a.parv" as
follows------------

disksim_synthio Synthio {

   Number of I/O requests to generate =  100,

   Maximum time of trace generated  =  1000.0,

   System call/return with each request =  0,

   Think time from call to request =  0.0,

   Think time from request to return =  0.0,

Generators = [

disksim_synthgen { # generator 0 

   Storage capacity per device  =  4155272,

   devices = [ disk0 ], 

   Blocking factor =  8,

   Probability of sequential access =  0.0,

   Probability of local access =  0.0,

   Probability of read access =  0.66,

   Probability of time-critical request =  0.0,

   Probability of time-limited request =  0.0,

   Time-limited think times  = [ normal, 30.0, 100.0  ],

   General inter-arrival times  = [ exponential, 0.0, 50.0  ],

Solved the first problem. It is due to the parameter loader. 

[ exponential, 0.0, 50  ] is explained as [ exponential, 0.0, 0  ].

It should be [ exponential, 0.0, 50.0 ]

I install Disksim in the manner that mention below:

*DiskSim does not compile in 64bit environment*. Never try it. Even if you

$ sudo apt-get install bison flex

*Step 1. Download and unzip.Sources can be downloaded from the links above.* I
downloaded DiskSim 4.0 with dixtrac.

$ cd disksim-4.0
$ unzip ../ssd-add-on.zip

*Step 2. Apply SSD add on patch.*

$ patch -p1 < ssdmodel/ssd-patch

Hello

You can compile Disksim under a 64-bit OS by forcing it to use 32-bit mode
compilation. You need to add -m32 to the compilation options. As for a
native 64-bit build, you *can* find some patches and pieces of code online
if you google for it. I don't know how reliable they are, considering
Disksim is very fickle, you would need extensive testing before you can be
sure about a 64-bit build working.

Regards,
Tarihi

It is not that hard compiling in 64 bit. Peter Macko posted the fix in a thread from December 2011, I think. It is a matter of initializing some pointers to NULL and removing a compile time assert which always fails in 64 bit. Applying the patch will take around 10 minutes.

My attempt at compiling a 64-bit binary did indeed fail an assert() that
checked the size() of a data structure against a constant. That was because
the data structure contained pointers and 64-bit means 8-byte pointers
instead of 4. I chose to abandon the endeavor at that point. My fear comes
from the fact that other hard-coded things may exist and break things in
transition from 32-bits to 64-bits, leading to memory corruption and other
nasty things.

As we are relying on Disksim to get research results, I'm afraid of using a
patch that hasn't been extensively tested (preferably with Valgrind or
something like that). Disksim is a pretty complicated beast, to the point
that later maintainers hadn't mastered the way the code worked (see the
text file in the doc directory).

Subject: [Disksim-users] How to handle all synthio requests before disksim
	stops
Message-ID: <6a7e75c1.34b7.1413f8b7ad2.Coremail.guoxf05@163.com>

 Hello:
     I found a phenomenon that is when using synthetic workloads, the actual handled requests may be less than generated request amount. For example, I configured "Number of I/O requests to generate" to 10000 and "Maximum time of trace generated" to 100000. I add printf in the ssd_event_arrive function to see the actual coming requests. What I finally found is a big surprise: only 5575 requests come to the ssd_event_arrive.
     Then I checked the code and found that in the function "synthio_generate_io_activity" of "disksym_synthio.c", disksim_simstop() will be invoked once the generated requests exceed 10000. At this moment, the generated requests have no time to be transferred to ssd_event_arrive and then simulation is over. The problem is that when I compare two methods using sythetic workloads, the actual handled request amount may be different even though the configurations are identical.
     So I want to ask what I can do if I want to get all the generated requests to be handled. I found a way: first print the generated requests and then use these requests as the external trace to disksim. However, this method seems a little ugly. Can anybody help me?
     Thank you very much!

Message-ID: <CAFLer81X=+CoFzKSXUnYy3=1SzdS5vLD393+DrP35nGqYM6QnA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm a PhD student in Johns Hopkins University and my research focus on
maximizing the IO performance of the SSD array. I want to use DiskSim
to simulate SSDs for development. But DiskSim failed to run on my
64-bit desktop.

When I compile it, I got a compilation error.
disksim_iosim.c: In function ?io_initialize?:
disksim_iosim.c:712:4: error: duplicate case value
disksim_iosim.c:712:4: error: previously used here

DISKSIM_EVENT_SIZE is 128 but the size of the ioreq_event structure is
larger than it. I guess the simulator was developed on a 32-bit
machine? Have anyone tested it on a 64-bit machine?

I tried to change DISKSIM_EVENT_SIZE to 256. The compilation can
succeed, but when I run runvalid, I got a bunch of segmentation
faults.

I tried DiskSim 4.0 and I haven't added the MSR patch for SSD
simulation. I run Ubuntu 12.04 and gcc version 4.6.3.

Can anyone help me fix the problem?

Thanks,
Da

This happens so often it should be a "sticky" topic or something.

You have to apply a "patch", which consists on changing a couple things in
some sources.

Peter Macko posted a link to the patch some time on December 2011, if I
recall correctly. The patch works (runvalid runs flawlessly), but, as some
people mentioned here, the results might have not been thoroughly tested,
so they may be unreliable.

Hope this helps,
- Rick

Unfortunately, the patch doesn't work to me. I can't even patch DiskSim.
I tried to patch DiskSim manually one by one, I still get segmentation fault :(
